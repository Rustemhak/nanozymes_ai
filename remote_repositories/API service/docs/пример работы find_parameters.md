The BiOI nanostructures were synthesized from Bi3+ ions and iodide ions (I-) in aqueous solution through the reaction Bi3+ + I- + H2O - BiOI(s) + 2H+ at room temperature. \\n\\nFor the preparation of BiOI nanostructures, 50 mM Tris–borate (pH 7.0, 1 mL), Bi(NO3)2 (10 mM, 50 mL), and potassium iodide (10 mM, 50 mL) were sequentially added to DI water (3.9 mL) under continuous stirring, and subsequently reacted at ambient temperature for 2 h in the dark. \\n\\nThe BiOI nanostructures were characterized using various techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the BiOI nanonetworks were obtained using a Tecnai 20 G2 S-twin transmission electron microscope. Samples for X-ray diffraction (XRD) were prepared by depositing the BiOI nanostructure solution on glass slides. XRD measurements were carried out at room temperature using a Rigaku 18 kW rotating anode source X-ray diffractometer (operated at 50 kV and 100 mA) with a Cu Ka1 line (l = 1.54 Å). Samples for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were prepared by depositing the BiOI nanostructure solution on a Si(100) wafer prior to measurement with a field emission SEM (JSM-6500F, JEOL, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). \\n\\nThe TEM, AFM, and SEM images reveal that BiOI has a nanonetwork-like structure that is formed through the connection of high-density small nanoplates (B20 nm) with thickness around B5 nm. The slow growth rate of BiOI and the hydrolysis of iodide result in the formation of BiOI having a nanonetwork structure. The yields of these nanostructures were all almost the same (B60%). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal that the BiOI nanostructures have typical tetragonal crystal structures and are predominantly exposed along the {001} facet. \\n\\nIn conclusion, the synthesis of BiOI nanostructures, including those with a size of approximately 20 nm, involves the reaction of Bi3+ ions and iodide ions in an aqueous solution at room temperature, with the use of specific reagents and under specific conditions. The resulting nanostructures are characterized by various techniques to confirm their size, structure, and other properties.')])"

For determination of the concentrations of metal ions using ICP-MS, the BiOI nanostructure samples were prepared in 2% HNO3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a VG ESCA Scientific theta probe spectrometer.\\n\\nThe TEM, AFM, and SEM images reveal that BiOI has a nanonetwork-like structure that is formed through the connection of high-density small nanoplates (approximately 20 nm) with a thickness around 5 nm. The slow growth rate of BiOI and the hydrolysis of iodide result in the formation of BiOI having a nanonetwork structure. The yields of these nanostructures were almost the same (approximately 60%). The XRD patterns reveal that the BiOI nanostructures have typical tetragonal crystal structures and are predominantly exposed along the {001} facet. Quantitative analysis using XPS, ICP-OES or ICP-MS reveals that the ratios of Bi to I in the BiOI nanostructures are higher than 1. This finding is consistent with the results of XRD, which shows that Bi2O3 is present in the BiOI nanostructures.')])"
