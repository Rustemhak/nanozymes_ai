The synthesis of 4 nm CoFe2O4 nanoparticles is described in the article. The process involves the use of several chemicals and specific equipment. 

The chemicals required for the synthesis include Fe(acac)3, Co(acac)2, 1,2-hexadecanediol (HDD), oleic acid, and phenyl ether. Specifically, 2 mmol of Fe(acac)3, 1 mmol of Co(acac)2, 10 mmol of 1,2-hexadecanediol, 6 mmol of oleic acid, and 20 mL of phenyl ether are used. 

The process begins with the mixing of these chemicals under a flow of nitrogen. The mixture is then heated to 200 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere with vigorous stirring, and then kept at that temperature for 1 hour. After this, the mixture is heated to reflux (265 °C) and kept at this temperature for another 30 minutes. The dark red-brown mixture is then cooled to room temperature by moving the heat source. 

Under ambient conditions, ethanol (40 mL) is added to the mixture, and a dark red-brown material is precipitated and separated via centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 3 minutes. The dark red-brown product is then dissolved in hexane.

The equipment used in this process includes a magnetic stirrer for mixing the chemicals, a heating device to achieve the required temperatures, and a centrifuge for the separation of the precipitated material. 

The article also mentions that the TEM measurements were carried out with a Philips EM 420 (120 kV) under ambient conditions, and the hysteresis loop was obtained at 300 K with a LakeShore 7400 VSM system. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of 4 nm CoFe2O4 nanoparticles involves a specific set of chemicals, precise control of temperature and stirring conditions, and the use of specific equipment for mixing, heating, and separation of the product."

The synthesis of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) of different sizes, including 13 nm, is described in the provided article. The method involves the co-thermolysis of iron and cobalt acetylacetonates precursors in the solvent of oleic acid. The different shapes and sizes of CoFe2O4 NPs can be produced by simply controlling the amount of Fe(acac)3 and Co(acac)2.

For the synthesis of 15 nm CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, Fe(acac)3 (8 mmol), Co(acac)2 (4 mmol) and oleic acid (15 mL) were mixed and magnetically stirred under a flow of nitrogen. The mixture was heated to 120 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere with vigorous stirring, and then kept at that temperature for 1 h. The obtained solution was then heated to 320 °C, and the solution color gradually became black, indicating that the magnetic nanoparticles were being formed. After refluxing for 4 h, the solution was cooled to room temperature, and a black precipitate was obtained upon addition of 50 mL of isopropyl alcohol and centrifuged. The product was washed with petroleum and ethanol (1/4, v/v) 3 times. Finally, the product was redispersed in hexane.

Under similar reaction conditions, the different size and shape CoFe2O4 NPs could be produced by simply controlling the amount of Fe(acac)3 and Co(acac)2. For example, the near corner-grown cubic NPs with 25 nm was synthesized using 2 mmol of Fe(acac)3 and 1 mmol of Co(acac)2, and the near cubic NPs with 45 nm was prepared using 4 mmol of Fe(acac)3 and 2 mmol of Co(acac)2. The amount of Fe(acac)3 and Co(acac)2 that synthesized star-shaped nanoparticles with 35 nm was same with the amount of that near corner-grown cubic NPs except using 330 °C.

Although the article does not provide specific details for the synthesis of 13 nm CoFe2O4 NPs, it can be inferred from the described methods that adjusting the amounts of Fe(acac)3 and Co(acac)2, as well as the reaction temperature, could potentially yield NPs of this size."

The method involves the co-thermolysis of iron and cobalt acetylacetonates precursors in the solvent of oleic acid.

The synthesis of 4 nm MnFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) involves several steps and reagents. The reagents include Fe(acac)3 (2 mmol), Mn(acac)2 (1 mmol), 1,2-hexadecanediol (10 mmol), oleic acid (6 mmol), oleylamine (6 mmol), and phenyl ether (20 mL). These were mixed and magnetically stirred under a flow of nitrogen. The mixture was then heated to 200 °C for 30 minutes and then, under a blanket of nitrogen, heated to reflux (265 °C) for another 30 minutes. The black-brown mixture was cooled to room temperature by removing the heat source. 

Under ambient conditions, ethanol (40 mL) was added to the mixture, and a black material was precipitated and separated via centrifugation. In order to remove the excess oleic acid and oleylamine on the surface of NPs, the NPs were washed by petroleum ether and ethanol mixed solution. Finally, the product was dispersed in hexane.

The synthesis of the 16, 18, and 27 nm MnFe2O4 NPs was obtained according to the literature with a little modification. The synthesis method was given in the Supporting Information. 

For the synthesis of DIB-PEH-NH-FA (1a), Folic acid (0.044 g, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 3 mL of dry dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) into which 0.040 g (0.15 mmol) of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and 0.014 g (0.12 mmol) of hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 hours at room temperature and then added with DIB-PEG-NH2 (200 mg). After another 12 hours of reaction, the product was precipitated by adding diethyl ether (20 mL) and dried in vacuo.

The synthesis of MnFe2O4-DIB-PEG-NH2 (1c), MnFe2O4 -DIB￾PEG-NH2 -FA (1d), and MnFe2O4 -DIB-PEG-NH-FA, FITC (1e) involved adding 0.02 g of MnFe2O4 NPs in 5 mL of CHCl3 to 0.02 g of 1a. The mixture was stirred 2h in the dark at room temperature.

The synthesis of manganese ferrite (MnFe2O4) nanoparticles of about 6 nm size was achieved using the inverse micelle method. The reagents used for this process included MnSO4·H2O and Toluene, which were BDH products, and NaOH purchased from Panreac. Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (NaDBS) and Fe2(SO4)3·5H2O were also used. All these chemicals were of pure grade for analysis and were used without further purifications.

In the synthesis process, aqueous 0.2 mol/L and 0.4 mol/L solutions of Mn(II) and Fe(III), respectively, were mixed to render a 1:2 molar ratio of Mn(II)/Fe(III) in a total volume of 5 mL of the ions solution. This solution was then mixed, under stirring, with 5 mL of 0.4 M aqueous solution of NaDBS followed by the addition of a large excess of toluene equal to 200 mL. The final mixture was maintained under vigorous stirring overnight, until a homogeneous dispersion containing a system of reverse micelle was obtained.

The 1 mol/L NaOH solution (8 mL) was drop-by-drop added to the starting solution, under vigorous stirring, to form colloids. Subsequently, the mixture volume was reduced by evaporation under vacuum. The practically dried product was then submitted to heat-treatment under an argon flow to obtain a fine powder. 

The synthesized product was characterized from X-ray diffraction (XRD), Mössbauer spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) data. The XRD powder pattern of the as-synthesized product showed that the pattern corresponds to the fcc unit cell typical of the spinel structure. According to the observed peak width at the half maximum, the average crystallite size for the obtained powders was about 6 nm.

The MgFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared using a hydrothermal method. The specific reagents used in the synthesis included MgCl2 6H2O (2.5 mmol) and FeCl3 6H2O (5 mmol), which were dissolved in ethylene glycol (40 mL) to form a clear solution. This was followed by the addition of NaAc (3.6 g) and polyethylene glycol 20000 (1.0 g). 

The mixture was stirred vigorously until the reactants dissolved, and then sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with a 50 mL capacity. The autoclave was heated to and maintained at 200 °C for 6 hours, and allowed to cool to room temperature. 

The resulting black products were washed several times with ethanol and deionized water, and dried at 60 °C for 6 hours. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses carried out showed that the MgFe2O4 NPs are regular spherical with an average size of about 220 nm. 

The surface morphology of the MgFe2O4 NPs was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was also used to determine the chemical composition of the as-prepared ferrite NPs products. Results from EDX spectra of prepared ferrite microspheres show that samples contain Mg, Fe, O for MgFe2O4 NPs. 

The crystallinity of the MgFe2O4 NPs was examined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The diffraction patterns are indexed to be MgFe2O4. These results are in agreement with that of the literature. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of MgFe2O4 NPs involves a hydrothermal method using specific reagents and conditions, and the resulting NPs are characterized using various techniques to confirm their size, morphology, and composition."

The synthesis of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) is described in the article. The procedure for synthesizing ZnFe2O4 NFs (nanoflowers) is as follows: Typically 0.14 g zinc sulfate (0.025 M) and 0.16 g anhydrous FeCl3 (0.05 M) were dissolved in 20 mL distilled water and 0.3 g urea (0.25 M) was added to it. Then the whole solution was stirred for 10 min to make the solution homogeneous. The molar ratio of the Zn2+: Fe3+: urea was maintained as 1:2:4. 

The morphology of the as-synthesized ZnFe2O4 was examined by FESEM and TEM analysis. Figure 2a,b display the FESEM images of as-synthesized ZnFe2O4, in lower and higher magnification, respectively. It has been observed from figure 2a,b that ZnFe2O4 has acquired 3D flowerlike morphology. Figure 2c,d demonstrate the TEM images of 3D ZnFe2O4. Highly magnified TEM image (figure 2d) of ZnFe2O4 reveals that the development of 3D flowerlike morphology is due to the self-assembly of 1D nanorods and occurred in presence of ZnSO4. The length and diameter of the individual nanorods are ~ 104 nm and ~ 27 nm, respectively.

The as-synthesized ZnFe2O4 is robust in nature. It has been observed that the flower-like morphology was intact even after annealing at 450 °C. In order to investigate the porous nature of the as-synthesized product, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm analysis has been done. The graph presented in Figure 5a conveys that the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm follows type IV category and the calculated Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area is 70.274 m2/g. According to the pore size distribution curve (figure 5b) the pore width of the material is 2.4 nm i.e. the flower-like robust ZnFe2O4 NF is mesoporous (2-50 nm) in nature.

The as-synthesized material conveys the peroxidase mimicking activity as well as acetone gas sensing property. Then peroxidase mimicking reaction i.e., blue color formation step has been found to be halted selectively by Hg2+ ion which detect and quantify Hg2+ ion in aqueous solution.

The synthesis of CdCo2O4 nanosheets, which can be considered as nanoparticles (NPs), is described in the article. However, the article does not specify the size of the synthesized NPs as 250 nm. The synthesis process involves several steps and uses various reagents and equipment.

The initial step involves the preparation of a basic deep eutectic solvent (DES). This is done by mixing KOH (0.28 g) and PEG-200 (44 g) in a 100 mL round-bottomed flask and heating it in an oil bath at 80 °C until a transparent liquid is obtained.

The CdCo2O4 nanosheets are then synthesized by dissolving an accurate amount of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (1 mM) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (2 mM) in 5 mL of the prepared DES. This mixture is heated to 80 °C for 2 hours on an oil bath. After this, the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and 5 mL of deionized water is added. The mixture is then shaken well and left to stand for 30 minutes to observe the suspension with crystalline particles.

The resulting pale green precipitate is collected by centrifugation and washed several times with water and ethanol. It is then dried at 60 °C overnight under an oven.

The synthesized CdCo2O4 nanosheets are then characterized using various techniques. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are used to study the surface morphology of the nanosheets. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) characterization and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) study are used to confirm the composition of the nanosheets. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses are carried out to verify the amorphous nature of the CdCo2O4. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) is conducted to confirm the chemical structure of the nanosheets. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analyses are observed to reveal the coexistence of elements Cd, Co, C, and O in the sample. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms are carried out to provide a more detailed characterization of the nanosheets. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is measured to confirm the high thermal stability of the nanosheets.

However, the article does not provide specific details on the size of the synthesized CdCo2O4 NPs. Further studies may be needed to control and determine the size of the NPs."

After 2 hours, the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and 5 mL deionized water was added. The mixture was then shaken well and left to stand for 30 minutes to observe the suspension with crystalline particles. Finally, the pale green precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed several times with water and ethanol, then dried at 60 °C overnight under an oven.

The synthesized CdCo2O4 nanosheets were characterized using various techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) characterization, and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) study.

The synthesis of CuWO4 nanoparticles (NPs) was achieved via a chemical precipitation reaction. In a typical experimental procedure, 2 mmol solutions of Cu(NO3)2 and Na2WO4 were prepared separately in 25 ml of distilled water with stirring. The Na2WO4 solution was then added dropwise into the Cu(NO3)2 solution with frequent stirring to form a cream green colored precipitate. 

After the completion of the precipitation reaction, the resultant product was transferred to a 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 175 ℃ for 24 hours. It was then allowed to cool to room temperature. The obtained precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and dried overnight. Finally, the samples were calcinated at 300⁰ C.

The surface morphology of the CuWO4 NPs was investigated using a Tescan VEGA3 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Tecnai 20 G2 (FEI make) High-Resolution Transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM). The low and high-resolution SEM and HR-TEM images revealed spherical morphology for CuWO4 NPs with an average particle size of 66 nm. 

The HRTEM images also showed visible lattice fringes for CuWO4 NPs with interplanar spacing of 0.296nm, 0.210 nm, 0.186nm, 0.225nm, 0.251nm, 0.243nm, 0.171nm, 0.201nm, 0.155 nm and 0.579, which are in agreement with the interplanar spacing of the (111), (-121), (130) (210), (0-21), (002), (-130), (211), (300) and (010) facets of triclinic CuWO4 NPs. 

The dispersion of Copper, Tungsten, and Oxygen atoms in the catalyst was analyzed by STEM elemental mapping. The elemental mapping confirmed the presence of Cu, W and O atoms. In addition, the elemental mapping result also revealed the homogeneous existence of Cu, W and O species. 

To identify the crystal structure, phase, and lattice parameters, the synthesized CuWO4 NPs were subjected to X-Ray Diffraction analysis. The high crystallinity of the sample is evident from the strong intensity peaks. Moreover, the diffraction peaks are in agreement with the wolframite structure of the copper tungstate (Reference code: 01-073-1823) with space group of P1 (2).

The synthesis of Co2V2O7 particles, which could potentially be manipulated to create nanoparticles, is described in the experiment section of the article. The method used is a simple hydrothermal method inspired by the report of Yu et al. 

To prepare Co2V2O7 particles, NH4VO3 (1.0 mmol) was dissolved in deionized water (30 mL) and stirred at 75 oC to obtain a transparent solution. Following this, deionized water (30 mL) containing 1.0 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O was added dropwise to the above solution to form a final suspension. The solution pH was then adjusted to 7 by adding 2.0 M NaOH dropwise. 

The resulting suspension was transferred to a sealed autoclave, which was heated at 180 oC for 15 h. The product, which was brown-green in color, was collected by centrifugation, washed several times with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 oC for 24 h. As a control, other cobalt vanadate samples were obtained by adjusting the solution pH to 3 and 11.

The crystallographic information on the Co2V2O7 particles was obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD), with the diffraction peaks in good agreement with the characteristic peaks of Co2V2O7 in the standard spectrum. Raman spectroscopy was also used to characterize the prepared materials. The bands at 905 and 845 cm1 were attributed to symmetric and asymmetric stretching of the VO4 units, respectively. Furthermore, the peaks located at 278 and 394 cm1, and 300, 552, and 598 cm1, were assigned to V–O and V–O–V stretching modes, respectively, indicating the successful preparation of Co2V2O7. 

The EDX spectrum of the prepared nanomaterial showed that it comprised 36.74% Co, 28.19% V, and 35.34% O by weight, with a V/O/Co atomic ratio of about 1:1:3.5, which matched well with the molecular formula Co2V2O7.

The synthesis of FeVO4 nanoparticles (NPs) was carried out through a facile hydrothermal method as described in the article. The specific procedure involved the use of 1.0 mmol of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 1.0 mmol of NH4VO3. The Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was added into 30 mL of Milli-Q water under magnetic stirring. Meanwhile, the NH4VO3 was dissolved in 30 mL of Milli-Q water under magnetic stirring and 80 ◦C heating to obtain a transparent solution. The NH4VO3 solution was subsequently added dropwise into the Fe(NO3)3 solutions slowly under vigorous stirring to form a final suspension. 

The pH of the solution was then adjusted to 4.0 by adding 2.0 M NaOH. The suspension was stirred for another 30 min and then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was sealed, maintained at 180 ◦C for 16 h, and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The precipitates were collected and washed several times with Milli-Q water, then with absolute ethanol, followed by drying at 60 ◦C in air for 6 h. The final product was denoted as FeVO4-4 (4 stands for at pH 4.0). 

As a control, some other FeVO4 samples were obtained by adjusting the pH to 1.0, 7.0 and 10.0, which were denoted as FeVO4-1, FeVO4-7 and FeVO4-10, respectively. The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 2000 nm FeVO4 NPs. However, it can be inferred that the size of the nanoparticles can be influenced by the pH value during the preparation process, as different pH values resulted in FeVO4 samples with different morphologies and structures. 

The characterization of the as-prepared samples was performed using various techniques. The crystal structure of the as-prepared samples was recorded by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on a Rigaku Ultima IV powder X-ray diffractometer. The structure and morphology of the as-prepared samples were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-1200, Japan). The chemical compositions of the as-prepared samples was recorded by FESEM equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the as-prepared samples was carried out with an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with an Al-anode (ESCALAB 250, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA). The hysteresis loop of the as-prepared samples was recorded by the vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, Lakeshore 7400, USA).

The β-AgVO3 nanorods were prepared using a simple and easy hydrothermal method. Initially, 0.170 g of AgNO3 was added to 30 mL of ultrapure water with magnetic stirring. Then, 0.085 g of NH4VO3 was added to this solution. The mixed solution was continuously stirred for 2 hours.

The article describes the synthesis of β-AgVO3 nanorods, not nanoparticles of a specific size like 800 nm. The β-AgVO3 nanorods were prepared using a hydrothermal method. The specific reagents used were silver nitrate (AgNO3) and partial ammonium vanadate (NH4VO3). The exact quantities used were 0.170 g of AgNO3 and 0.085 g of NH4VO3. These were added to 30 mL of ultrapure water and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours.

The SEM images showed that the prepared β-AgVO3 exhibit nanorod-like morphology. The nanorod diameter was 28–80 nm and the length was 0.4–1.2 μm. The obtained β-AgVO3 nanorods were smaller than the AgVO3 nanobelts, which indicated that the catalytic activity of β-AgVO3 nanorods should be higher than that of the AgVO3 nanobelts.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 5000 nm CoMoO4 nanoparticles. The synthesis process described in the article is for CoMoO4 nanobelts (NBs), nanosheets (NSs), and three-dimension (3D) hierarchical microspheres (MPs), but not for nanoparticles of a specific size like 5000 nm.

The synthesis of CoMoO4 materials was performed using a hydrothermal method. Specifically, 1.0 mmol of CoCl2·6H2O and 1.0 mmol Na2MoO4·2H2O were dissolved in 30 mL Milli-Q water under vigorous stirring, respectively. Then Na2MoO4 solution was added dropwise into CoCl2 solution slowly under magnetic stirring to form a suspension, which was transferred into a 100-mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave afterwards. The autoclave was sealed, maintained at 160 °C for 16 h, and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation, thoroughly washing repeatedly with Milli-Q water and ethanol several times, and drying at 60 °C in air for 6 h. Then, CoMoO4 nanobelts were obtained and denoted as CoMoO4 NBs.

Other CoMoO4 materials with different morphologies were prepared by changing “molybdenum” source and additional agent. Belt-like CoMoO4 materials (BLs) with larger size were obtained by a similar way as CoMoO4 NBs except for using 1.0 mmol (NH4)6Mo7O4·4H2O as “molybdenum” source instead of Na2MoO4·2H2O, which were denoted as CoMoO4 BLs. CoMoO4 nanosheets (NSs) were prepared by adding 1.0 mmol urea in the preparation process with other conditions same to CoMoO4 BLs, which were denoted as CoMoO4 NSs. CoMoO4 materials with the structure of three-dimension (3D) hierarchical microsphere (MPs) were obtained by using 5.0 mmol urea in the preparation process with other conditions same to CoMoO4 NSs, which were denoted as CoMoO4 MPs.

The crystal phase and structure of the CoMoO4 samples were analyzed by Rigaku Ultima IV powder X-ray diffractometer (Japan) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The microstructure and morphology of the samples were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 1500 nm AgVO3 nanoparticles. However, it does detail the process for synthesizing AgVO3 nanobelts, which are nanostructures with a variable size from 0.5 up to several μm in length and 100 nm in width. 

The AgVO3 nanobelts were synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method. Initially, 1 mmol of NH4VO3 was dissolved in an aqueous solution of 30 mL and then 0.5 g of PEG10000 was added under vigorous stirring condition at room temperature. Afterward, 30 mL of AgNO3 solution (0.067 M) was gradually added dropwise under vigorous stirring condition, followed by dropwise addition of ammonia with a final pH value of 7. After being stirred for 30 min, the solution was transferred into a 100 mL of Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed and maintained at 160 °C for 24 h. After that, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally. The resulting yellow precipitate was separated by centrifugation and washed three times with water and ethanol respectively, dried at 60 °C for 4 h, and then collected for characterization and detection.

The reagents used in this process, including NH4VO3, AgNO3, ammonia, and PEG10000, were all of analytical reagent grade, and used as received without further purification. Milli-Q water was applied throughout the experiment.

The characterization of the synthesized AgVO3 nanobelts was done using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The XRD pattern of the samples was recorded on a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer using monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) with 2θ ranging from 10 o to 80 o (40 kV, 40 mA). The SEM was used to characterize the morphologies of the synthesized samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were measured on a Hitachi JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.

Please note that while this method was used to synthesize AgVO3 nanobelts, it may not be directly applicable for the synthesis of 1500 nm AgVO3 nanoparticles. The size and shape of nanoparticles can be influenced by various factors including the concentration of the precursors, the reaction temperature, the reaction time, and the type of surfactants used. Therefore, further optimization and modification of the synthesis process may be required to obtain AgVO3 nanoparticles of a specific size."

The synthesis of CuMnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) is described in the experimental section of the article. The CuMnO2 NPs were prepared using a modified low temperature hydrothermal method. 

The chemicals and reagents used for the synthesis include Cu(NO3)2∙3H2O and Mn(NO3)2∙4H2O, which were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd and Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd respectively. NaOH was also used and was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Millipore water (18.2 MΩ) was used throughout the experiments.

In terms of the quantities used, 15 mmol Cu(NO3)2∙3H2O and 15 mmol Mn(NO3)2∙4H2O were dissolved in 70 mL deionized water at room temperature. Then 4.40 g NaOH was added to the above solution.

The preparation process involved stirring the mixture to obtain a homogeneous suspension. The solution was then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The reaction was kept at 80 ºC for 24 hours. The obtained reddish brown precipitate was washed with deionized water and absolute alcohol successively, and finally dried at 60 ºC for 24 hours.

The characterization of the synthesized NPs was extensively described. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for Zn-CuO and CuO was obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance X-107 ray diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ=1.5418 Å) as the source. XPS analysis was performed with Omicron 95 nanotechnology XPS system, (X-ray source: Al Kα, 1486.6 eV). DLS studies measurements were carried out on a Nano ZS Malvern Zeta sizer instrument.

The sample was prepared by dispersing Zn-CuO NPs in isopropyl alcohol, placing a drop of this suspension on a copper-coated grid and drying the grid in vacuum.

Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements were carried out to determine the ratio of Cu:Zn in Zn-CuO (Cu0.89Zn0.11O). HR-TEM images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100 model operated at an accelerated voltage of 200 kV. HR-SEM measurements were conducted on Magellan 400L HRSEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). The absorption studies and reaction kinetics were carried out using a CARY 103 bio-100 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence measurements of 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid were recorded by a Cary Eclipse fluorimeter.

The production of •OH radicals was determined by electron spin resonance (ESR) using a 121 Bruker EPR 100d X-band spectrometer with DMPO as a spin trap. To 80 µL of Zn-CuO (0.1 mg mL-1), 10 µL of DMPO (0.01 M) and 10 µL of H2O2 were added and drawn by a syringe into a gas-permeable Teflon capillary.

The synthesis of (CeO2)0.10/CoO nanoparticles (NPs) is achieved through a two-step route composed of a one-pot solvothermal process and heat treatment. The process begins with the addition of Co(NO3)2 powder (1 mmol) into a homogeneous mixture containing glycerin and isopropanol (16 and 60 mL, respectively). This mixture is then vigorously stirred for 1 hour. 

Following this, Ce(NO3)3 (0.10 mmol) is added into the mixture and stirred for another 10 hours. The reaction system is then subjected to heat treatment for 6 hours under 180 °C. The precipitate is purified by washing with water and ethanol and then dehydrated overnight at 60 °C. 

In the next step, the precursor is roasted at 400 °C for 2 hours with protection of N2 flow. The final samples are named as nCeO2/CoO NCs. In addition to this, CeO2 and CoO NPs are also fabricated using the same method. 

It's important to note that the molar ratio of Ce3+/Co2+ salts is regulated during the solvothermal process to successfully synthesize the flower-like heterostructured 0.10CeO2/CoO NCs.

The synthesis of (CeO2)0.10/CoO nanoparticles (NPs) is achieved through a two-step route involving a one-pot solvothermal process and heat treatment. The process begins with the addition of Co(NO3)2 powder (1 mmol) into a homogeneous mixture containing glycerin and isopropanol (16 and 60 mL, respectively). This mixture is then vigorously stirred for 1 hour. 

Following this, Ce(NO3)3 (0.10 mmol) is added into the mixture and stirred for an additional 10 hours. The reaction system is then subjected to heat treatment for 6 hours under 180 °C. The resulting precipitate is purified by washing with water and ethanol and then dehydrated overnight at 60 °C.

In the final step, the precursor is roasted at 400 °C for 2 hours with protection of N2 flow. The final samples are named 0.10CeO2/CoO NCs. In addition to this, CeO2 and CoO NPs are also fabricated using the same method.

It's important to note that the molar ratio of Ce3+/Co2+ salts is regulated during the solvothermal process to successfully synthesize the flower-like heterostructured 0.10CeO2/CoO NCs. The resulting NPs exhibit high peroxidase-like activity under a pH of 5 and a wider temperature range of 26.5−43 °C. 

The synthesized NPs also retain more than 80% of their initial catalytic activity after repeated use for 6 times or storing for 30 days, making them greatly promising for applications in medical diagnosis. Based on the remarkable performance of 0.10CeO2/CoO NCs, a sensitive and selective colorimetric sensing strategy was established for Cys detection. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of (CeO2)0.10/CoO NPs requires specific reagents, precise molar ratios, and controlled heat treatment processes. The resulting NPs exhibit high peroxidase-like activity and are suitable for use in various applications, including medical diagnosis and colorimetric sensing."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 1500 nm CoO/CeO2 nanoparticles. However, it does detail the synthesis of mesoporous 5%CoO/CeO2 with a pore size of approximately 14 nm. 

The synthesis process involves three steps. In the first step, the core-shell structured composite micelles of PEO-b-PS/inorganic sol were formed, containing hydrophobic PS blocks in the core and hydrophilic PEO segments with metal salt precursors in the shell. In the second step, the composite micelles packed into ordered fcc mesostructure with evaporation of solvent. In the third step, ordered mesoporous 5%CoO/CeO2 was formed by direct calcination in air at 350 ◦C to remove the template and promote framework crystallization.

The reagents used for the synthesis include PEO-b-PS, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, and Co(acac)2. Specifically, 0.05 g of PEO-b-PS was dissolved in 3.5 mL of THF, and 0.15 g of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and 10.2 mg of Co(acac)2 were dissolved in 0.5 mL of absolute ethanol. The two solutions were mixed together under stirring for 1 h, and then the formed homogeneous solution was casted onto Petri dishes, which were held at 40 ◦C for 3 days to evaporate THF, and then heated at 100 ◦C for another 3 days. The solid inorganic-polymer composite was scratched from the plates and crushed into fine powders, which were finally calcined at 350 ◦C in air for 2 h to burn off PEO-b-PS template and promote framework crystallization, and the sample of mesoporous 5%CoO/CeO2 was obtained.

The synthesized mesoporous 5%CoO/CeO2 was characterized using various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). 

However, the article does not provide specific information on how to adjust the synthesis parameters to achieve a nanoparticle size of 1500 nm."

All these reagents were of analytical reagent grade and used without further purification. Deionized water from a Milli-Q Plus system (Millipore) was used in all solutions and experiment.

The synthesis process begins with the dissolution of 0.02 g of (Co(Cl)2.6H2O) in 10 mL of distilled water. Subsequently, 0.01 g of PVP and urea are added to the solution under vigorous stirring. Then 100 µL of NH3 (Wt %: 25-28 %) is added to the reaction solution. After stirring for 15 min, 10 ml of 4.6 mM cerium nitrate aqueous solution is mixed with the prepared solution. Next, a sufficient amount of ammonia solution is added to the mixture under vigorous stirring to adjust the pH to about 10. The precipitate product is then transferred to a 40-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept in an electric oven at 180 °C for 16 h. The autoclave is then taken out from the oven and left to cool to room temperature. The produced precipitate is collected via centrifugation, washed thoroughly with water and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C overnight.

The synthesis of Fe3O4@CeO2 nanoparticles (NCs) involves several steps and requires a variety of materials and reagents. 

Firstly, Fe3O4 hollow nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared through a modified solvothermal reaction. This process requires 0.8 g of FeCl3·6H2O and 2.0 g of NH4Ac, which are dissolved in 40 mL of ethylene glycol with vigorous stirring. Then, 1.0 mL of TMEDA is added. The mixture is stirred vigorously for 2 hours to form a homogeneous yellow solution, which is then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with a 50 mL capacity. The autoclave is heated to 200 °C and maintained for 10 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the dark product is collected, rinsed with ethanol several times, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight for further experiments.

Next, CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized. This involves stirring 0.12 g of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.18 g PVP in 19 mL of deionized water until a colorless transparent solution is obtained. Then, 1 mL of DMF and 0.1 mL H2O2 are added. The obtained solution is transferred to a stainless-steel sealed autoclave with a 50 mL capacity and maintained at 180 °C for 20 hours. The grey product is collected by centrifuge and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight.

Finally, the yolk–shell Fe3O4@CeO2 NCs are acquired using a one-pot coating process. 50 mg of Fe3O4 hollow NPs is dispersed in 80 mL of 0.4 mol/L glucose solution under ultrasonication for 30 minutes. Then, 0.4 g of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.6 g of urea are added to the above mixture. After 30 minutes of sonication, the homogeneous mixture is transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 8 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the dark precipitate is collected and washed with ethanol several times with magnetic separation. Finally, the as-prepared Fe3O4@CeO2 yolk–shell NCs are dried at 60 °C for 20 hours in a vacuum oven.

The synthesis process involves several steps, starting with the preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and MnO2 microspheres, followed by the synthesis of the Fe3O4-MnO2 composite.

For the synthesis of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, a hydrothermal process is used. In a typical experiment, a solution is prepared by dissolving 0.80 g of FeCl3·6H2O, 2.00 g of NH4Ac, and 0.30 g of TBAB in 40 mL of ethylene glycol. This solution is stirred for 30 minutes and then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (50 mL). The autoclave is sealed and maintained at 200 °C for 10 hours. After cooling down to room temperature, the resulting product is collected with a permanent magnet and washed with ethanol and deionized water several times. Finally, the products are freeze-dried.

The synthesis of MnO2 microspheres involves dissolving 0.68 g of MnSO4 and 0.92 g of (NH4)2S2O8 in 40 mL of deionized water.

The synthesis of Fe3O4-MnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) is described in the provided text. However, the text does not specify the size of the nanoparticles produced, such as 2000 nm. The synthesis process involves several steps, starting with the preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and MnO2 microspheres, followed by the synthesis of the Fe3O4-MnO2 composite.

For the synthesis of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, a hydrothermal process is used. In a typical experiment, a solution is prepared by dissolving 0.80 g of FeCl3·6H2O, 2.00 g of NH4Ac, and 0.30 g of TBAB in 40 mL of ethylene glycol. This solution is stirred for 30 minutes and then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (50 mL). The autoclave is sealed and maintained at 200 °C for 10 hours. After cooling down to room temperature, the resulting product is collected with a permanent magnet and washed with ethanol and deionized water several times. Finally, the products are freeze-dried.

The synthesis of MnO2 microspheres involves dissolving 0.68 g of MnSO4 and 0.92 g of (NH4)2S2O8 in 40 mL of deionized water. This solution is then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (50 mL) and maintained at 120 °C for 2 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the precipitate is collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and deionized water several times. Finally, the products are freeze-dried.

The Fe3O4-MnO2 composite is synthesized by adding the as-prepared Fe3O4 nanoparticles (20 mg), 0.68 g of MnSO4, and 0.92 g of (NH4)2S2O8 in 40 mL of deionized water. This mixture is then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (50 mL) and maintained at 120 °C for 2 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the precipitate is collected with a permanent magnet and washed with ethanol and deionized water. Finally, the products are freeze-dried.

The formation process of the Fe3O4-MnO2 composite was tracked with TEM image observation. The reaction solution pH was detected with time, decreasing from 2.6 to 1.4. The structure of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles, MnO2 microspheres, and Fe3O4-MnO2 composite were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The morphology and composition were analyzed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and field emission transmission electron microscope (FETEM). Nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements were carried out using a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 instrument. The specific surface area was calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods. Magnetization measurements were performed by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM)."

The synthesis of Pt/WO2.72 nanoplates was carried out using a one-pot solvothermal method, with some modifications from a previous study. The precursors used for the reaction were WCl6 and H2PtCl6, which reacted with oleic acid and oleylamine in 1-octadecene.

Initially, 100 mg of WCl6, 5 mL of 1-octadecene (ODE), and 3 mL of oleylamine (OAm) were mixed to form a bright yellow solution. Then, 10 mL of ODE and 6 mL of oleic acid (OAc) were added into the mixed solution. Under magnetic stirring, 0.25 mmol of H2PtCl6 in ethanol was added into the above solution. After degassing under a gentle N2 flow at 70 °C for 30 min, the solution was heated up to 240 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and maintained for 10 h.

The synthesis of Ce-doped Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Ce-Fe3O4 NPs) was carried out via an electrochemical method. The deposition experiments were conducted in a two-electrode electrochemical cell containing a stainless-steel cathode and a graphite anode. The electrolyte used for the experiment was prepared by dissolving 1 g of iron(II) chloride (FeCl2.4H2O, 99%), 2 g of iron(III) nitrate (Fe(NO3)2.9H2O, 99.95%), and 0.3 g of cerium chloride (CeCl3.7H2O, 99%) in 1 L of aqueous solution.

The cerium ferrite nanoparticles were prepared through direct current (DC) electrodeposition. The parameters for the electrodeposition were set at a current density of 20 mA cm-2, a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, and a time duration of 30 minutes. After the deposition, the prepared powder was repeatedly rinsed with distilled water and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.

Finally, the deposits were scraped from the substrate and evaluated by characterization analyses. The average crystallite size was calculated to be about 10.5 nm for the prepared nanoparticles using the Debye–Sherrer equation. The FE-SEM image of the prepared nanoparticles showed that the prepared sample is composed of spherical shape particles with a mean size of 15 nm.

The results of elemental analyses of the electrosynthesized sample based on energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) revealed that the nanoparticles contain Fe, Ce, and O in the mass percentages of 53.34%w, 20.42 %w, and 26.24%w respectively. Based on the results, the sample was determined to be 20% Ce doped Fe3O4. 

All the UV-visible measurements were conducted using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 25 spectrophotometer. The FT-IR spectrum of the electrosynthesized powder was also analyzed. This spectrum contains the characteristic bands of nano-sized magnetite, which include two sharp bands at about 575 and 632 cm–1, due to the splitting of the ν1 band of the Fe—O and/or Ce-O, and a wide one at 439 cm–1 due to the ν2 band of the Fe—O and/or Ce-O bonds."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 246 nm Fe3O4 nanoparticles. However, it does describe the process of synthesizing Fe3O4 nanoparticles in general. 

In a typical experiment, the solution for the synthesis of Fe3O4 nanoparticles was prepared by dissolving 0.80 g of FeCl3·6H2O, 2.00 g of NH4Ac and 0.30 g of TBAB in 40 mL of ethylene glycol.

Finally, the products were freeze-dried.

The article mentions that highly uniform Fe3O4 nanoparticles were easily obtained by a hydrothermal process with TBAB as a capping agent for the stabilizer. The structure of Fe3O4 nanoparticles was analyzed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD). The diffraction peaks of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles at 2θ = 30.14°, 35.49°, 37.35°, 43.14°, 53.62°, 57.22° and 62.67° corresponded to (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511) and (440), respectively, which could be indexed to Fe3O4 with face-centered cubic structure.

The morphology of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles was observed by TEM. Fe3O4 nanoparticles are uniform spheres and the average diameter is about 350 nm. The HAADF-SEM image and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were also used in the characterization of the nanoparticles.

The Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared using a hydrothermal process. TBAB was used as a capping agent for the stabilizer in the hydrothermal process. The presence of Fe3O4 nanoparticles in the preparation adjusted the nucleation and growth rates of MnO2. These crystallites aggregate into a complex structure leading to a perturbed and disorganized Fe3O4-MnO2 lattice rich in defects, dislocations and vacancies, which are active sites for the generation of OH· radicals.

The structure of Fe3O4 nanoparticles was analyzed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD).

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of CuO nanoparticles (NPs) of a particular size such as 5 nm. However, it does describe the synthesis and characterization of Zn-doped CuO NPs, also referred to as Zn-CuO NPs. 

The Zn-CuO NPs were obtained by a facile one-step sonochemical synthesis. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for Zn-CuO and CuO was obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance X-107 ray diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ=1.5418 Å) as the source. XPS analysis was performed with Omicron 95 nanotechnology XPS system, (X-ray source: Al Kα, 1486.6 eV). 

The morphological microstructure was characterized by JEM-1400, JEOL transmission electron microscopy (TEM) model, operated at 120 kV. The sample was prepared by dispersing Zn-CuO NPs in isopropyl alcohol, placing a drop of this suspension on a copper-coated grid and drying the grid in vacuum. 

Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements were carried out to determine the ratio of Cu:Zn in Zn-CuO (Cu0.89Zn0.11O). HR-TEM images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100 model operated at an accelerated voltage of 200 kV. HR-SEM measurements were conducted on Magellan 400L HRSEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). 

The TEM images show the aggregated morphology of Zn-CuO nanocrystals 5-10 nm long. A comparative TEM image of pure CuO is also shown.

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of CuO nanoparticles (NPs). The synthesis and characterization process described in the article is for Zn-doped CuO NPs (Zn-CuO NPs), not pure CuO NPs. 

The Zn-doped CuO NPs were obtained by a facile one-step sonochemical synthesis. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to differentiate the doped nanomaterial from its pristine CuO counterpart. The XRD pattern for Zn-CuO and CuO was obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance X-107 ray diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ=1.5418 Å) as the source. 

The morphological microstructure was characterized by JEM-1400, JEOL transmission electron microscopy (TEM) model, operated at 120 kV. The sample was prepared by dispersing Zn-CuO NPs in isopropyl alcohol, placing a drop of this suspension on a copper-coated grid and drying the grid in vacuum. 

Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements were carried out to determine the ratio of Cu:Zn in Zn-CuO (Cu0.89Zn0.11O). HR-TEM images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100 model operated at an accelerated voltage of 200 kV. HR-SEM measurements were conducted on Magellan 400L HRSEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). 

The DLS measurements indicated an average particle size of about 180 nm. The TEM images show the aggregated morphology of Zn-CuO nanocrystals 5-10 nm long. A comparative TEM image of pure CuO is also shown. The rough surface of the aggregated crystals results in an increase in the surface area of the overall nanomaterial which plays a significant role in the enhancement of the enzymatic activity by facilitating the adsorption of the substrate molecules onto the surface.

However, the article does not provide specific details on the reagents, their quantities, or the exact process used to synthesize the CuO NPs."

The article describes the synthesis of GeO2 nanozymes, which are a type of nanoparticles, using a hydrothermal strategy. However, the specific size of the nanoparticles produced is not explicitly stated in the article. 

In the synthesis process, GeO2 and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution were used as the initial materials. Specifically, GeO2 (0.9 m) and NaOH solution (0.3 m) were added into 10 mL of water and stirred at 25 °C overnight. Then, 12 mL of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution (0.3 m) was poured into the mixed solution. After stirring for another 6 hours, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon bottle and heated at 100 °C for 56 hours.

Subsequently, the impurities were removed from the resulting product by washing with ultrapure water and alcohol, respectively. Finally, the as-prepared GeO2 nanozymes were obtained via vacuum drying at room temperature.

The morphology of the GeO2 nanozymes was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Small-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded to further compare GeO2 nanomaterials and raw GeO2. The elementary composition and valence state of GeO2 nanozymes were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

It's important to note that while the article describes the synthesis of GeO2 nanozymes, it does not provide specific details on how to control the size of the nanoparticles to achieve a specific size such as 1000 nm. The size of the nanoparticles produced would likely depend on the specific conditions and parameters used during the synthesis process."

The manuscript does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 1 nm WO2.92 nanoparticles (NPs). The synthesis process described in the manuscript is for WOx quantum dots (QDs), not specifically for WO2.92 NPs. 

The WOx QDs were synthesized by a simple and green hydrothermal process using WS2 as the precursor. In brief, 30 mg of commercial WS2 powder was dispersed in 200 mL water (65 °C). After ultrasonication for 17 h, the suspension was filtered using a 0.22 µm microporous membrane resulting in a silver gray filter cake. Then, the resulting filter cake was suspended in 30 mL water, and reacted at 200 °C for 12 h in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. After the solution cooled, the suspension was filtered by a 0.22 µm membrane to remove large stands of the products, yielding a colorless solution. The supernatant containing WOx QDs was obtained.

The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the WOx QDs were collected with JEM-2100 TEM instrument (JEOL, Japan). The energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) fitted to a TEM operating on a nanoprobe mode was used for elemental analysis. The fluorescence and the absorption spectra were recorded with an Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Varian) and Hitachi UV-2450 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan), respectively.

The synthesis of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) of different sizes, including 14 nm, was achieved by the citrate reduction method as previously described in the article. The colloidal solutions of 14, 25, 48, and 99 nm diameter GNPs were synthesized using this method. 

The process involved adding 1 mL of 1% HAuCl4 solution (gold chloride tetrahydrate) into 97 mL of ultrapure water and heating it to boiling. Then, 2 mL of 1% trisodium Citrate solution was quickly added to the reaction system, keeping it boiling for 15 minutes. The different sizes of GNPs were obtained by adjusting the proportion of sodium citrate and HAuCl4 in the reaction system. 

For the synthesis of 14 nm GNPs, the volume of 1% HAuCl4 was 1 and the volume of 1% trisodium citrate was 5. For other sizes, the volumes were adjusted accordingly. For instance, for 25 nm GNPs, the volume of 1% HAuCl4 was 1 and the volume of 1% trisodium citrate was 1.5. For 48 nm GNPs, both volumes were 1, and for 99 nm GNPs, the volume of 1% HAuCl4 was 1 and the volume of 1% trisodium citrate was 0.42. 

The Au concentrations were all unified to 47.8 µg·mL−1. The characterization of the synthesized GNPs was done using UV-vis absorption spectra obtained with a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis performed on a JEM-2000EX microscope. 

It's important to note that all the reagents used were of analytical grade and ultrapure water obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q water purification system was used throughout the experiments."

The synthesis of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) of different sizes, including 14 nm, was achieved by the citrate reduction method as previously described in the article. The colloidal solutions of 14, 25, 48, and 99 nm diameter GNPs were synthesized using this method. 

The process involved adding 1 mL of 1% HAuCl4 solution (gold chloride tetrahydrate) into 97 mL of ultrapure water and heating it to boiling. Then, 2 mL of 1% trisodium Citrate solution was added to the reaction system quickly, keeping it boiling for 15 minutes. The different sizes of GNPs were obtained by adjusting the proportion of sodium citrate and HAuCl4 in the reaction system. 

For the synthesis of 14 nm GNPs, the volume of 1% HAuCl4 used was 1 and the volume of 1% trisodium citrate was 5. For other sizes, the volumes were adjusted accordingly. For instance, for 25 nm GNPs, the volume of 1% HAuCl4 was 1 and the volume of 1% trisodium citrate was 1.5. For 48 nm GNPs, equal volumes of 1% HAuCl4 and 1% trisodium citrate were used. For 99 nm GNPs, the volume of 1% HAuCl4 was 1 and the volume of 1% trisodium citrate was 0.42.

The Au concentrations were all unified to 47.8 µg·mL−1. The synthesized GNPs were then characterized using UV-vis absorption spectra obtained with a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis performed on a JEM-2000EX microscope."

The synthesis of a-Fe2O3 nanostructures, including 110 nm nanoparticles, is described in the experimental section of the article. The materials and methods used for the synthesis of these nanomaterials are detailed.

All chemicals used for the synthesis of nanomaterials and enzyme kinetic assay such as iron chloride (FeCl36H2O), urea ((NH2)2CO), caffeine, citric acid, sodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4) and DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without any further purification. A stable, chromogenic and non-carcinogenic horse radish peroxidase (HRP) substrate, TMB (3,30,5,50-tetramethyl benzidene), was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from Samchun Pure Chemicals, South Korea.

The synthesis of a-Fe2O3 nanostructures was carried out using aqueous routes. To begin with, a-Fe2O3 nanorods were synthesized through hydrolysis of iron chloride (FeCl36H2O) by a hydrothermal method with slight modification in the earlier synthesis route. In a typical synthesis procedure, 0.02 M iron chloride solution was prepared in preheated deionized water at 90 1C. After a certain period of time, varying concentrations of HCl were added, which is a key factor in controlling size, leading to the formation of different sized b-FeOOH nanorods. The respective flasks were magnetically stirred at 90 1C for 24 h, culminating into yellow coloured mixtures. Thus obtained yellow coloured mixtures are indicative of the formation of b-FeOOH nanorods and were cooled to room temperature, centrifuged, washed repeatedly with deionized water and ethanol and then dried overnight at 80 1C in an oven.

The as-synthesized b-FeOOH nanorods were then used as a precursor for various uniform a-Fe2O3 nanorods. The b-FeOOH rods were slowly heated at the rate of 2 1C min1 upto 250 1C and maintained for 2 h under static conditions. This procedure transforms the precursors to brown coloured hematite a-Fe2O3 rods. During the transformation, apparent shape and size of the b-FeOOH were maintained in the resulting a-Fe2O3 nanorods. The resultant rods with different lengths were the outcome of different HCl concentrations used during the synthesis procedure and are labelled R-1, R-2, and R-3 according to their length.

In addition, cube-like a-Fe2O3 particles were synthesized using 0.06 mol of iron chloride (FeCl36H2O) and 0.03 mol of caffeine instead of hydrochloric acid or urea in aqueous solution. The flask was magnetically stirred for 24 h at 90 1C. The mixture was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature, and the resultant brown product, also indicative of formation of hematite, was isolated through centrifugation with successive washings by deionized water and ethanol and dried at 80 1C overnight.

The as-synthesized a-Fe2O3 nanostructures were characterized by using various analytical techniques. The microscopic features of the samples were elucidated with a transmission electron microscope (TEM, EM 912 Omega) operated at 120 kV and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (SEM, LEO 1455VP, Hitachi S-4700) operated at an acceleration voltage of 25 kV. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were obtained with a Rigaku 1200 diffractometer with CuKa radiation using a Ni b-filter at a scan rate of 41 min1. The X-ray source was operated at 40 kV and 30 mA."

The a-Fe2O3 hexagonal prisms were synthesized using urea as a reducing agent. A certain amount of urea was dissolved in preheated deionized water at 90 1C with vigorous stirring, followed by addition of iron chloride. The molar ratio of iron chloride to urea used was kept at 1.0 : 7.5. After addition of iron chloride, the colour of the solution changed to brown. The solution was stirred for 12 h at the same temperature and the resulting nanostructures were isolated by centrifugation with repeated washings.

Cube-like a-Fe2O3 particles were synthesized using 0.06 mol of iron chloride (FeCl36H2O) and 0.03 mol of caffeine instead of hydrochloric acid or urea in aqueous solution.

The article describes the synthesis and modification of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) of different sizes, including 300 nm. The Fe3O4 MNPs were prepared according to the solvothermal method and the co-precipitation method. However, the article does not provide specific details about the solvothermal method used for the synthesis of 300 nm Fe3O4 MNPs.

For the modification of Fe3O4 MNPs, the article provides a detailed procedure. For silica coating and amino modification of Fe3O4 MNPs, 26 mg Fe3O4 nanoparticles were mixed with 20 ml 2-propanol and 40 ml ethanol.

To confirm the reproducibility of the findings, Fe3O4 MNPs were produced in two independent labs, and the behaviour of the MNPs from the two sources was found to be consistent.

In terms of equipment, the article mentions the use of a mechanical stirrer for the reaction mixture, a centrifuge for separating the core-shell nanostructures from the reaction medium, and a spectrophotometer for monitoring the reactions.

The synthesis of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) of approximately 150 nm, 300 nm, and 30 nm in size was performed using the solvothermal method and the co-precipitation method. The size distribution of these MNPs has been characterized previously. For the synthesis of Fe3O4 MNPs with dextran, the same procedure was followed but with the addition of dextran.

For the silica coating and amino modification of Fe3O4 MNPs, 26 mg of Fe3O4 nanoparticles were mixed with 20 ml of 2-propanol and 40 ml of ethanol. Then, 0.5 ml of deionized water and 1.5 ml of ammonia solution (25% by weight) were consecutively added to the reaction mixture. Under continuous mechanical stirring, APTES and TEOS (tetraethoxysilane) with different ratios (0 or 1:4, total 400 ml) were added into the reaction solutions. The reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 8 hours.

After the coating reaction, the core–shell nanostructures were separated from the reaction medium by centrifuging at 3,000 r.p.m., and dispersed into ethanol. The separation procedure was performed several times. To confirm the reproducibility of the findings, Fe3O4 MNPs were produced in two independent labs, and the behaviour of the MNPs from the two sources was found to be consistent.

Before coupling with the antibody, the dextran-modified Fe3O4 MNPs were activated by incubation with NaIO4 (2 mg ml-1) at 37 °C for 20 minutes, washed three times with 0.2 mol l-1 NaAc, pH 4.4, and suspended in 0.1 mol l-1 NaHCO3, pH 9.6. The Fe3O4 MNPs were then incubated with 100 mg ml-1 anti-TnI antibody at 4 °C overnight. NaBH4 was added to a final concentration of 2 mg ml-1 to stop the coupling reaction. After washing with PBS three times, the antibody-coupled Fe3O4 MNPs were stored at 4 °C for the capture–detection immunoassay."

The synthesis of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) was performed by following the procedure reported by Racuciu et al. with slight modifications. The reagents used for the synthesis included 3.6 gm FeCl3 .6H2O and 1.8 gm FeSO4 .7H2O salts, which were dissolved in 80 mL MilliQ water. At 80 0C, nitrogen gas was purged into the mixture and 20 mL of NH4OH was added slowly (the solution turns black). The temperature of 80 oC was maintained for further 30 min with continuous N2 bubbling.

After this, an external magnet was used to pellet down the NPs and the supernatant was discarded. The washing step was carried out for 4 to 5 times with boiled MilliQ water to remove excess ammonia. To the pellet solution (~30 mL), 2.5 gm of citric acid was mixed and stirred at 90 oC for 2 h. After cooling down to room temperature, Fe3O4 NPs were dialyzed for 24 h in MilliQ water using a 12 KDa dialysis membrane (water was changed every 8 hours). 

After dialysis, the NPs were washed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to remove the remnants. In the final step, the Fe3O4 NPs solution was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 6 min and the supernatant was collected.

The particle size of the synthesized Fe3O4 NPs was measured using a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) equipped with 20-120 kV (JEM1400 plus, JEOL). Phase identification of Fe3O4 NPs was analysed over the 2θ range from 20 – 900 using X-ray diffraction (XRD) system (Bruker AXS, D8 Discover). The concentration of Fe3O4 NPs for zeta potential measurement was 1 mg/mL in PBS. Further the zeta potential studies of NPs were followed in presence of ATP and ascorbic acid (AA) at pH 7.4. For dispersion, this suspension was gently vortexed for 20 sec and zeta potential was determined using Dynamic Light Scattering (Zetasizer Nano-ZS, ZEN3600) Malvern instruments Ltd. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) spectra was measured in the range of 500 – 4000 cm-1 using Spectrum Two FT-IR Spectrometer, L160000A, PerkinElmer.

The article describes the synthesis of nickel oxide nano-flowers (NiO NFs), not nanoparticles (NPs). The synthesis of NiO NFs involves two main steps: the formation of β-Ni(OH)2 NFs and their subsequent calcination to produce NiO NFs.

In the typical synthesis of β-nickel hydroxide nano-flowers (Ni(OH)2 NFs), 0.8 mL of ethanol amine is added to 4.2 mL of 0.1 M nickel acetate (Ni(OAc)2) solution in a screw-capped test tube of 25 mL capacity to form a blue colored nickel–ethanol amine complex. The resulting blue colored solution is sealed in the screw-capped test tube and subjected to overnight (12 h) heating under modified hydrothermal (MHT) conditions at 110 °C. After a specific time of 12 h, a uniform greenish-white thin film on the glass slide is deposited and the solid film is recovered by decanting the clear supernatant solution. The thin film is then washed several times with water and dried in an air oven for 1 h at 60 °C.

To obtain gray-black nickel oxide nano-flowers (NiO NFs), the greenish-white precursor is annealed at 350 °C for 4 h under ambient conditions in a tube furnace. The morphology of the light-green colored β-Ni(OH)2 NFs was examined using different microscopic techniques. The architectures have an average diameter of 3–5 mm and consist of interconnected, smooth surfaced wavy plates of 15 nm thickness. The morphology of Ni(OH)2 resembles a flower structure.

The morphological analyses were performed with the calcined product of β-Ni(OH)2 NFs, i.e. NiO NFs. The size of the walnuts almost remains the same, but the interplate spacing is different, which has already been mentioned. This increased spacing increases the porous nature of the material, NiO NFs. From the FESEM images, the highly porous nature of the NiO NFs can be observed.

The porous nature of β-Ni(OH)2 NFs and calcined product NiO NFs are evident from FESEM and TEM analyses. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements were studied to investigate their surface porosity. The calculated Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas are 50.363 and 113.707 m2 g−1 for β-Ni(OH)2 and NiO NFs, respectively. The Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method is used for measurement of pore diameter distribution of β-Ni(OH)2 and NiO NFs. The pore size for β-Ni(OH)2 NFs is 3.1 nm, which has been increased to 3.8 nm for NiO NFs."

In the first step, β-Ni(OH)2 NFs are synthesized hydrothermally. Specifically, 0.8 mL of ethanol amine is added to 4.2 mL of a 0.1 M nickel acetate (Ni(OAc)2) solution in a 25 mL capacity screw-capped test tube to form a blue-colored nickel–ethanol amine complex. A glass slide is submerged in this solution, which is then sealed in the test tube and subjected to modified hydrothermal conditions at 110 °C for 12 hours. After this period, a uniform greenish-white thin film forms on the glass slide. This film is recovered by decanting the clear supernatant solution, washing it several times with water, and drying it in an air oven for 1 hour at 60 °C.

In the second step, the greenish-white precursor is calcined to produce gray-black NiO NFs. This involves annealing the precursor at 350 °C for 4 hours under ambient conditions in a tube furnace. The resulting NiO NFs have a flower-like structure, with interconnected, smooth-surfaced wavy plates of 15 nm thickness.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of NiO nanoparticles (NPs) of 15 nm or any other size. The described process specifically produces NiO in a nano-flower (NF) structure, not in a nanoparticle (NP) form. Therefore, a different method would likely be needed to synthesize NiO NPs."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 4800 nm Co3O4/CeO2 nanoparticles. However, it does detail the preparation of Co3O4-CeO2 nanocomposites, which have an average size of approximately 6 nm. 

The Co3O4-CeO2 nanocomposites were prepared by a wet-chemical deposition precipitation method. Initially, 0.02 g of Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate (Co(Cl)2.6H2O) were dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water. Subsequently, 0.01 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and urea were added to the solution under vigorous stirring. Then 100 µL of NH3 (Wt %: 25-28 %) was added to the reaction solution. After stirring for 15 min, 10 ml of 4.6 mM cerium nitrate aqueous solution was mixed with the prepared solution. 

Next, a sufficient amount of ammonia solution was added to the mixture under vigorous stirring to adjust the pH to about 10. The precipitate product was then transferred to a 40-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept in an electric oven at 180 °C for 16 h. The autoclave was then taken out from the oven and left to cool to room temperature. The produced precipitate was collected via centrifugation, washed thoroughly with water and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C overnight. The pure Co3O4 and CeO2 was synthesized with the same procedure.

The characterization of the prepared nanomaterials was done using SEM (MIRA3 TESCAN HV: 20.0 KV from Czech Republic) and TEM (EM 280, Tokyo, Japan). XRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a copper source and a general area detector diffraction system (GADDS). UV-vis detection was carried out on SPECTROD 250-analytikjena spectrophotometer (Germany).

The mimic peroxidase properties of Co3O4-CeO2 were tested by dispersing Co3O4-CeO2 (3 mg) in PBS buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.0) in the presence of 200 μL TMB (0.8 mM) and H2O2 (1.2 mM) with a total volume of 1.0 ml. After the mixed solution was processed at 30 oC for 10 min, the photographs and UV spectra of the mixtures were taken.

The synthesis of Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) was carried out through a hydrothermal method. The reagents used for the synthesis included cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2•6H2O) and hexamethylene tetramine (HMTA), both used in a quantity of 0.1 mmol. These were dissolved in 16 ml of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) under magnetic stirring for 15 minutes.

The synthesis of Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) of around 31 nm size, as described in the article, involves a process that combines electrospinning with calcination. The materials used for the synthesis include polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 1,300,000), ethanol, Co(NO3)26H2O, and deionized water. The exact amount of Co(NO3)26H2O used can affect the size of the nanoparticles, with the article mentioning that 0.115 g, 0.23 g, and 0.45 g were used in different experiments.

In the typical synthesis of the sol, 1.0 g of PVP is dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol with magnetic stirring. Once the PVP is completely dissolved, an aqueous solution prepared by dissolving 0.45 g of Co(NO3)26H2O in 2 mL of deionized water is added. After the mixture becomes homogeneous, it is transferred to a needle tube with an inner diameter of 0.5 mm. The electrospinning voltage is set at 20 kV and the receiving distance between the needle and collector is 20 cm, while the pumping speed is 0.002 mm/s.

After the electrospinning process, the mat-like fiber is collected and heated at 80 °C overnight. Finally, the dried gel fiber is heated to 300 °C in a tube furnace with a heating rate of 1°C/min and kept at 300 °C for 1 h. Then it is heated to 400°C with a heating rate of 0.5 °C/min, and kept at that temperature for 2 h.

The morphology of the products is characterized using SEM and TEM. The electrospun gel fibers present a belt-like morphology with a width of ca. 4.9±1.5 μm and thickness of 0.6±02 μm. After calcination at 400 °C for 2h, the belt-like morphology is retained while the width of the belt reduces to 1.9±0.6 μm. The belts are composed of nanoparticles and some pores are observed. The HR-TEM image shows continuous parallel lattice fringes and the lattice spacings are ca. 0.24 nm and 0.29 nm, which are consistent with the {311} and {220} interplanar spacings of Co3O4.

The amount of cobalt nitrate in the precursor sol can affect the size of the nanoparticles. As the amount of cobalt nitrate increased from 0.115 g to 0.23g and 0.45 g, the grain sizes of the calcined samples, denoted as F1, F2, and F3, were calculated to be 31.1± 1.1 nm, 48.1 ± 1.9 nm and 26.9 ± 1.1 nm respectively according to the Scherrer equation."

The synthesis of Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) of around 31 nm size is described in the provided text. The synthesis process involves an electrospinning technique combined with calcination. 

In the typical synthesis of the sol, 1.0 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 1,300,000) was dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol with magnetic stirring. When PVP dissolved completely, the aqueous solution prepared by dissolving 0.45 g of Co(NO3)2•6H2O in 2 mL of deionized water was added.

To investigate the effect of the amount of cobalt nitrate in the precursor sol, the amount of cobalt nitrate was varied with other conditions constant. As the amount of cobalt nitrate increased from 0.115 g to 0.23g and 0.45 g, all the obtained gel fibers present belt-like morphology while their width increased. The corresponding calcined fibers are denoted as F1, F2, and F3. From the XRD patterns, the diffraction peaks of the three calcined samples are ascribed to cubic Co3O4 and the grain sizes of F1, F2, and F3 are calculated 31.1± 1.1 nm, 48.1 ± 1.9 nm and 26.9 ± 1.1 nm according to Scherrer equation.

In summary, the synthesis of Co3O4 NPs involves the use of PVP, ethanol, Co(NO3)2•6H2O, deionized water, and a needle tube with a 0.5 mm inner diameter. The process involves electrospinning with a voltage of 20 kV, a receiving distance of 20 cm, and a pumping speed of 0.002 mm/s, followed by heating and calcination.

The synthesis of sisal-like architectures of cobalt hydroxide carbonate precursors, which can be transformed to Co3O4 nanoparticles, was first synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method with cobalt nitrate as cobalt source and urea as a precipitating agent. The sisal-like architectures of cobalt hydroxide carbonate precursors can be transformed to Co3O4 by calcination without destroying the structures. 

In a typical synthesis, 0.44 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.18 g of CO(NH2)2 were dissolved into deionized water under magnetic stirring to form a transparent solution. The solution then was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated to 160 °C and maintained at that temperature for 6 h. Subsequently, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally. After that, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol three times, and dried at 70 °C for 12 h in air to obtain the precursors. The final product was obtained by calcining the precursor to 400 °C for 1 h in the muffle furnace in air with a heating rate of 1 °C/min.

The crystal structure of the product was determined on an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/Max 2200 PC) with a graphite monochromator and Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The morphology of the product was determined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (Toshiba, Model S4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM, Model 1011). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a SDT Model Q600 thermogravimetric analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under an air atmosphere. The ultraviolet−visible (UV−vis) absorption spectra were tested using a Model Lambda 35 type UV-vis spectrometer (Perkin−Elmer).

The sisal-like cobalt hydroxide carbonate precursors were synthesized as described and analyzed with SEM and XRD. As shown in Figure 1a, the precursor exhibits sisal-like morphology with the size of ca. 10 μm, and the microstructures are accumulated by nanorods. The diameter of the nanorod is ca. 125 nm from TEM image (Figure 2). 

In conclusion, the synthesis of Co3O4 nanoparticles involves a hydrothermal method using cobalt nitrate and urea, followed by calcination. The process also requires various equipment for stirring, heating, and analysis, including a stainless steel autoclave, muffle furnace, X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, thermogravimetric analyzer, and UV-vis spectrometer."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 68 nm Co3O4 nanoparticles. However, it does describe the preparation of porous Co3O4 nanoplates. 

In a typical procedure, 1 g Pluronic F127 and 0.25 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O were respectively dissolved in 50 mL deionized water. Then, the mixture solution was stirred and heated to 80 °C by a water bath. Subsequently, 0.75 mL ammonia solution was added into the above solution. The whole mixture was stirred at 80 °C for another 1 h. The product was collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm and washed thoroughly with deionized water several times. After drying at 60 °C, the obtained product named Co(OH)2-F was calcined at 450 °C for 2 h under air with a heating rate of 2°C min-1 to form the porous Co3O4 nanoplates (Co3O4-F).

According to the above method, Co(OH)2-P and Co3O4-P were synthesized by replacing Pluronic F127 with P123. In the case of Co(OH)2 and Co3O4, a similar procedure was applied except for adding any soft template.

The apparatus used for the experiment included a Cary 500 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer (Varian) for UV/Vis absorption measurements, a PHILIPS XL-30 field-emission scanning electron microscope for SEM experiments, a JEM￾2100F high-resolution transmission electron microscope for TEM measurements, and a D8 ADVANCE (Bruker, Germany) X-ray diffractometer for obtaining X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns.

The chemicals used in the experiment, including Pluronic® F127, Pluronic® P123, 3, 3', 5, 5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and glucose oxidase (GOx, from Aspergillus niger, 50 KU, 128.2 KU g-1), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ammonia solution (NH3, 25%), Co(NO3)2·6H2O, glucose, fructose, maltose, lactose and sucrose were obtained from Beijing Chemical Reagent Company (Beijing, China). All the chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Ultrapure water (≥18.2 MΩ cm) was used throughout the study."

The article describes the synthesis of porous Co3O4 nanoplates, not specifically 68 nm Co3O4 nanoparticles. However, the procedure might be useful for the synthesis of Co3O4 nanoparticles of different sizes with some modifications.

In the described procedure, 1 g of Pluronic F127 and 0.25 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O were respectively dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water. The mixture solution was stirred and heated to 80 °C by a water bath. Subsequently, 0.75 mL of ammonia solution was added into the above solution. The whole mixture was stirred at 80 °C for another 1 hour. The product was collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm and washed thoroughly with deionized water several times. After drying at 60 °C, the obtained product named Co(OH)2-F was calcined at 450 °C for 2 hours under air with a heating rate of 2°C min-1 to form the porous Co3O4 nanoplates (Co3O4-F).

According to the above method, Co(OH)2-P and Co3O4-P were synthesized by replacing Pluronic F127 with P123. In the case of Co(OH)2 and Co3O4, a similar procedure was applied except for adding any soft template.

The equipment used in this procedure includes a water bath for heating the mixture, a centrifuge for collecting the product, and an oven for drying and calcining the product. The reagents used are Pluronic F127, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and ammonia solution. The article does not provide specific molar amounts for these reagents.

It's important to note that the size of the resulting Co3O4 nanoplates might be influenced by factors such as the concentration of the reagents, the temperature and duration of the heating steps, and the speed and duration of the centrifugation step. Adjusting these parameters might allow for the synthesis of Co3O4 nanoparticles of a specific size, such as 68 nm. However, further experimentation would be needed to determine the exact conditions required."

The synthesis of Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) was achieved using a one-step green strategy based on a solution-phase method at room temperature. This method is template-free and surfactant-free. The reagents used in the synthesis include a freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (10 mM) and a clear purple CoCl2 solution (2 mM). The NaBH4 solution was dropwise added into the CoCl2 solution under gentle stirring and further incubation at room temperature overnight.

Upon the addition of the reducing agent NaBH4, the CoCl2 solution rapidly turned grey and produced bubbles, probably due to the reduction of Co2+ to Co and the generation of H2. Subsequently, the grey suspension quickly became black because the newly generated Co was very unstable and could be spontaneously oxidized to CoO swiftly by the dissolved oxygen. Further, some of the black CoO was slowly oxidized to Co2O3 by oxygen, to form Co3O4, indicated by the gradual appearance of a yellowish-brown suspension during continuous stirring at 25 °C for 12 h.

The morphology of the as-synthesized nanostructure was examined by SEM and TEM, which revealed a hierarchical flower-like sphere. The nanospheres were composed of sheets ranging from several nanometers to a dozen nanometers. The formation mechanism of nanoflowers may be because the initial Co3O4 nanosheets have higher surface energy and tend to reduce surface energy during growth, so the nanosheets will further aggregate into spheres. Finally, a graded nanoflower sphere composed of nanosheets is stably formed. The size of Co3O4 nanoflowers is 360 ± 20 nm, indicating that the synthetic method is controllable and reproducible.

The XRD patterns of the synthesized sample can be indexed to the Co2+Co3+2O4. XPS spectrum was employed to confirm the valence states of the sample. The XPS survey spectrum of the sample indicated the co-existence of Co and O in the sample. For Co 2p, four fitted peaks can be observed centered at 780.4 eV, 782.0 eV, 795.8 eV and 797.5 eV, related to Co3+ 2p3/2, Co2+ 2p3/2, Co3+ 2p1/2 and Co2+ 2p1/2, respectively. The O 1s high resolution spectrum region displays three peaks locating at 530.1 eV (for surface lattice oxygen), 531.2 eV (for oxygen vacancies).

In conclusion, the synthesis of Co3O4 NPs involves a one-step green strategy at room temperature using NaBH4 and CoCl2 solutions, with the resultant NPs exhibiting a hierarchical flower-like sphere morphology and a size of 360 ± 20 nm. The synthesized NPs were characterized using SEM, TEM, XRD, and XPS techniques."

The synthesis of Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) involves a two-step process, which includes the formation of Co(OH)2 nanoflowers and the generation of Co3O4 nanoflowers via annealing treatment of the Co(OH)2 nanoflowers. 

In a typical synthesis, CoCl2$6H2O (analytical pure, AR, 2 mmol) was added into 20 ml of deionized water with stirring for 10 min to generate solution A. Meanwhile, L-arginine (C6H14N4O2, >99% purity, 10 mmol) was dissolved into 20 ml deionized water with stirring for 10 min to generate solution B. Solution B was then added dropwise into solution A with stirring for 30 min. This mixture was sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave, heated at a designated temperature (such as 120 C, or 150 C, or 180 C) and maintained at that temperature for a designated time (such as 10 h, or 5 h, or 15 h). After the autoclave cooled down to room temperature naturally, the pink sediment Co(OH)2 was collected and washed with deionized water and then absolute alcohol three times, followed by drying at 80 C for 3 h. The black Co3O4 powder was then obtained after heat treating the pink Co(OH)2 powder at 300 C for 1 h.

The reaction between CoCl2$6H2O and L-arginine [H2N–C(¼NH)–NH–(CH2)3–CH–(COOH)NH2], which is basic with a pK ¼ 12.5,14 is shown in eqn (2):
CoCl2 + H2N–C(¼NH)–NH–(CH2)3–CH–(COOH)NH2 + 2H2O / Co(OH)2 + 2[H2N–C(¼NH)–NH–(CH2)3–CH (COOH)–NH3 + ]Cl− (2) And the Co3O4 was obtained after annealing of Co(OH)2, as shown in eqn (3):15 6Co(OH)2 + O2 / 2Co3O4 + 6H2O (3)

The Co(OH)2 nanoflowers undergo a three-stage growth process, similar to the nucleation–growth–assembly (N–G–A) mechanism. The first stage of Co(OH)2 nanoflowers formation is the nucleation process, that is, the initial reaction between Co2+ and L-arginine [C6H14N4O2, HN2–C(¼NH)–NHCH2CH2CH (COO−)–NH3 + ] ions is too fast to generate the Co(OH)2 nuclei. The second stage of Co(OH)2 nanoflowers formation is the oriented growth to form Co(OH)2 nanoplates with a lateral thickness of 30 nm. The third stage of Co(OH)2 nanoflowers formation is the self-assembly of nanoplates via hydrogen bonding aggregation, leading to the generation of the hierarchical structure – gillyflower-like Co(OH)2 superstructures."

The synthesis of CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) is described in the provided text. The synthetic protocol for preparing CeO2 NPs is provided in ESS 1.1. The cerium precursor used for the synthesis is Cerous chloride heptahydrate (CeCl3⋅7H2O, purity 98.5%), which was purchased from Loba chemicals. The synthesis also involves the use of Liquid Ammonia (NH4OH, purity 99%) acquired from Fisher Scientific. 

The morphology of the synthesized CeO2 NPs was observed using Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; JSM-7600F, JEOL) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM; Technai G2 F30 model 300kV, FEI). The phase identification and structure information was acquired from X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV, Rigaku) with CuKα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm) analysed over the Bragg’s angle from 20° to 80°. 

The TEM and FE-SEM images examined for ~50 nanorods using ImageJ [23]. Log normal function to length histogram reveals mean length (x) of 197±13.4 nm and 214.85±6.4 from TEM and FE-SEM images, respectively. 

The synthesis of CeO2 NPs was realized via co-precipitation using CeCl3·7H2O. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns confirms crystalline nature and corresponds to (111) plane in agreement with XRD results. The nanorods grow through Ostwald ripening process. In this work, Cl￾in cerium precursor salt favours nanorod formation which accords to Wu et. al. observations [25]. Employing PIS (precipitant into precursor salt) approach at high pH (~10.5) owed to low Ce(OH)3 solubility (Ksp) expedite nano rod nuclei formation, later at high temperature (60ºC) Ostwald ripening contribute to formation of CeO2 nanorods.

The TEM and FE-SEM images examined for ~50 nanorods using ImageJ revealed a mean length of 197±13.4 nm and 214.85±6.4 from TEM and FE-SEM images, respectively. 

The CeO2 NPs were synthesized using an aqueous route with Cerous chloride heptahydrate (CeCl3⋅7H2O, purity 98.5%) as the precursor. The process involved co-precipitation, which was realized with CeCl3·7H2O. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns confirmed the crystalline nature of the NPs. The nanorods were found to grow through the Ostwald ripening process, which involves the continual consumption of smaller particles forming larger crystals. 

The role of counter anions in controlling the size and morphology of CeO2 NPs was also noted. In this work, Cl- in the cerium precursor salt was found to favor nanorod formation. The PIS (precipitant into precursor salt) approach was employed at high pH (~10.5) due to the low solubility of Ce(OH)3, which expedited the formation of nano rod nuclei. Later, at high temperature (60ºC), Ostwald ripening contributed to the formation of CeO2 nanorods.

The equipment used for the characterization of the NPs included a Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; JSM-7600F, JEOL) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM; Technai G2 F30 model 300kV, FEI). Phase identification and structure information were acquired from an X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV, Rigaku) with CuKα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm) analyzed over the Bragg’s angle from 20° to 80°.

The synthesis of CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) is described in the provided text. The synthetic protocol for preparing CeO2 NPs is provided in ESS 1.1. The cerium precursor used for the synthesis is cerous chloride heptahydrate (CeCl3⋅7H2O, purity 98.5%). The synthesis process involves an aqueous route using CeCl3·7H2O via co-precipitation to realize CeO2 NPs. 

The morphology of the synthesized NPs was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; JSM-7600F, JEOL) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM; Technai G2 F30 model 300kV, FEI). The phase identification and structure information were acquired from X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV, Rigaku) with CuKα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm) analysed over the Bragg’s angle from 20° to 80°. 

The TEM and FE-SEM images examined for ~50 nanorods using ImageJ [23]. Log normal function to length histogram reveals mean length (x) of 197±13.4 nm and 214.85±6.4 from TEM and FE-SEM images, respectively. 

The formation of nanorods is influenced by the role of counter anions in controlling size and morphology of CeO2 NPs. In this work, Cl￾ in cerium precursor salt favours nanorod formation. Employing PIS (precipitant into precursor salt) approach at high pH (~10.5) owed to low Ce(OH)3 solubility (Ksp) expedite nano rod nuclei formation, later at high temperature (60ºC) Ostwald ripening contribute to formation of CeO2 nanorods. 

However, the text does not provide specific details on the exact quantities of reagents used or the precise steps involved in the synthesis process. For a more detailed protocol, one would need to refer to the ESS 1.1 section mentioned in the text."

The synthesis of CeO2 nanostructures, including nanocubes and nanorods, is described in the article. However, the article does not specify the synthesis of 32 nm CeO2 nanoparticles. 

For the synthesis of CeO2 nanostructures, 20mL of Ce(NO3) 3·6H2O solution (0.1mol/L) was added dropwise into NaOH solution (0.1mol/L for nanocubes and 12mol/L for nanorods). The mixed solution was then transferred and sealed in a 50mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, with subsequent heating for 24h. The heating temperature was kept at 140 °C for nanocubes and 100 °C for nanorods. After the reaction, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 5min) and washed alternately with ethanol and deionized water several times, and then dried at 60 °C in the air.

The phase structure of the samples was identified by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418Å). NIST SRM™ 640e was used to obtain the instrumental broadening profile. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a spectrometer (Axis Ultra DLD-600W, Kratos Analytical Ltd.) using Al Kα radiation as the excitation source. The morphologies of the samples were observed using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100F STEM/EDS, JEOL Corp, Japan). The Raman spectra of the samples were recorded by a Raman spectrometer with a 325nm laser excitation (VERTEX 70, Bruker, Germany). The UV-Vis spectra of the samples were recorded with an ultraviolet–visible spectrometer (Shimadzu Corp., UV-2550 PC).

The peroxidase mimetic activity of CeO2 was evaluated by monitoring the redox reaction between TMB and H2O2 in the presence of the CeO2 nanostructures. Typically, 1mL acetate buffer solution (50mM, pH=4.0) containing 25μg CeO2, 0.5μmol TMB, and 1mol H2O2 was added in a cuvette. The reaction was monitored using an ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (Shimadzu Corp., UV-2550 PC) at a wavelength of 652 nm. The measurement was recorded at an interval of one minute and the temperature was kept at 25 °C. 

All the non-linear curve fittings (XRD, XPS and Michaelis-Menten Kinetic) were processed using software Fityk (version 1.3.0). All the experiments were repeated at least triplicated to obtain the standard deviation."

The synthesis of CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) is described in the provided text. The hydrothermal temperature and time played important roles in the CeO2 NPs synthesis, which were demonstrated to optimize experiments. The synthesis conditions were optimized through adjusting the reaction temperature from 120 to 180 C at intervals of 20 C and the reaction time from 12 to 24 h at intervals of 4 h, respectively. 

The XRD patterns of the samples prepared under the different reaction conditions were analyzed. The surface residue is gradually eliminated as the temperature increases, and the CeO2 NPs were obtained under 180 C. The XRD patterns of samples under the same reaction temperature (180 C) and the reaction time varied (12 h and 24 h), the diffraction peaks observed show a good match with CeO2 (JCPDS 81-0792). 

The prepared CeO2 NPs has a cubic, fluorite-type structure and high purity. The average diameters of the four CeO2 samples prepared under the 180 C, evaluated by means of the Scherrer formula,32 are about 16, 15, 20, 12 nm for the CeO2 NPs obtained from the reaction times of 12 h, 16 h, 20 h, 24 h, respectively. This suggests that the CeO2 NPs with the smallest size obtained under reaction condition at 180 C for 24 h. 

The CeO2 NPs obtained under different hydrothermal reaction conditions were also investigated through FT-IR spectra. The adsorption bands of sample (120 C, 24 h) were similar to the spectrum of propane diacid, which could not be decomposed completely below 180 C. In the FT-IR spectra, the Ce–O stretching band around 400 cm1 confirms the formation of CeO2 when the reaction temperature reaches up to 180 C. 

The surface of the as-prepared CeO2 NPs is negatively charged due to nitrate groups which were encircling by positive proton forming double electrical layer in redispersion. To further confirm this, the TG was used to identify the chemical species on surfaces of the prepared CeO2 NPs. The TG profile exhibits slight weight loss stages in the temperature range between 35 and 900 C. The first stage of weight loss below 150 C was assigned to desorption of the adsorbed water, and the decomposition of nitrate group species caused the weight loss between 300 and 400 C, as suggested by the FT-IR outcomes. 

The UV-vis spectroscopy of CeO2 suspension was also used to verify their well redispersed properties. According to Beer’s law, absorbance at the characteristic peak was in a linear relationship with concentration when a homogeneous solution was formed. A good linear relationship (R ¼ 0.9995) exists between the absorbance at 304 nm and the concentration of CeO2 NPs redispersion. 

The morphology of the obtained CeO2 NPs under the optimal reaction conditions was examined by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The crystallite size is distributed in a narrow range between 8 and 14 nm, which is in good agreement with the results of XRD analysis. The electron diffraction rings, together with the data cited from the JCPDS card show the (111), (200), (220) and (311) diffraction rings, confirming the nanocrystallinity and the fluorite structure. 

The Ce 3d electron core level XPS spectrum for as-prepared CeO2 NPs are shown. The XPS spectrum from cerium is complex and splits into Ce 3d3/2 and Ce 3d5/2 with multiple shake-up and shake-down satellites. The peaks between 875 and 895 eV belong to the Ce 3d5/2 while peaks between 895 and 910 eV correspond to the Ce 3d3/2 levels. These results are consistent with previously published results of CeO2 NPs. Higher intensity peaks corresponding to Ce4+ were observed in sample, indicating a higher Ce4+/Ce3+ ratio. XPS analysis reveals that a slight reduced surface of the CeO2 NPs could be obtained by simple hydrothermal synthesis at the optimal reaction condition."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 17 nm CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs). However, it does describe the preparation of CeO2-MMT nanocomposites and CeO2 NPs in general. 

The preparation of CeO2-MMT nanocomposites begins with dissolving 0.5 g MMT in 30 mL distilled water under vigorous stirring for 18 hours to form a homogeneous suspension. Then, 0.217 g (approximately 0.5 mM) Ce(NO3)3·6H2O solution, which serves as a precursor providing Ce3+ cation, is added dropwise into the solution under continuous stirring for another 2 hours. Following this, 2 mL hydrogen peroxide (30%) is cautiously added into the obtained solution. After stirring the solution for one more hour, the mixture is sealed in a polytetrafluoroethylene-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 150 degrees Celsius for 6 hours. The solution is then naturally cooled to room temperature, separated by centrifugation, and washed with deionized water three times. Finally, the products are collected and dried under atmospheric conditions at 60 degrees Celsius for 10 hours. The CeO2-MMT nanocomposites are then obtained and used in the following experiments.

For comparative investigation, CeO2 NPs and CeO2-MMT hybrids are also prepared. The preparation of CeO2 NPs is similar to that of the CeO2-MMT nanocomposites, but without the presence of MMT. The CeO2-MMT hybrids are prepared by mixing MMT with CeO2 NPs in distilled water under vigorous stirring for 3 hours.

The article does not provide specific details on the size of the CeO2 NPs produced in these experiments. However, it does mention that the CeO2 nanoparticles decorated on the layers of MMT in the CeO2-MMT composites have a mean size of approximately 10-25 nm. The pure CeO2 NPs without MMT are prone to aggregation due to the absence of a support. The aggregated CeO2 NPs have a relatively better physical dispersity on the layers of MMT when MMT is used as the support under continuous stirring for a relatively long time at room temperature. These dispersed CeO2 nanoparticles on layers of MMT are named as the CeO2-MMT nanohybrids."

The article does not provide specific instructions for synthesizing 17 nm CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs). However, it does describe the general process of preparing CeO2 NPs and CeO2-MMT nanocomposites. 

Firstly, 0.5 g MMT was dissolved in 30 mL distilled water under vigorous stirring for 18 hours to form a homogeneous suspension. After that, 0.217 g (ca. 0.5 mM) Ce(NO3)3·6H2O solution as a precursor serving Ce3+ cation was dropwise added into the above solution under continuously stirring for another 2 hours. Then, 2 mL hydrogen peroxide (30%) was cautiously dropwise added into the obtained solution. After the solution being stirred for one more hour, the mixture was sealed in a polytetrafluoroethylene-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 150°C for 6 hours. Subsequently, the solution was naturally cooled to room temperature, separated by centrifugation and washed with deionized water for three times. Finally, the products were collected and dried under atmospheric condition at 60°C for 10 hours. The CeO2-MMT nanocomposites were obtained and used in the following experiments.

For comparative investigation, the preparation of CeO2 NPs was similar to that of the CeO2-MMT nanocomposites in the absence of MMT. The CeO2-MMT hybrids were prepared by mixing MMT with CeO2 NPs in the distilled water under vigorous stirring for 3 hours.

The microstructure and morphology of the CeO2-MMT composites, the pure CeO2 NPs and hybrid materials were imaged by TEM. From the images, it can be seen that the CeO2 nanoparticles with the mean size of ca. 10-25 nm were well decorated on the layers of MMT. However, the pure CeO2 NPs without MMT were easy to aggregate, due to the absence of a support. 

The article does not provide specific details on how to control the size of the CeO2 NPs to 17 nm. The size of the nanoparticles can often be controlled by adjusting the synthesis conditions, such as the concentration of the precursor, the reaction temperature, and the reaction time, but these details are not provided in the article."

CeO2 nanorods were prepared according to a previous report. In a typical procedure, Ce(NO3)3 (8 ml, 0.05 M) was added rapidly to H2O2 (8 ml, 30.0%) solution and stirred for ca. 10 min. The suspension was transferred into a 25 ml Teflon-lined autoclave, which was heated at 250 °C for 3 h. The system was then allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The final product was washed with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Then CeO2 nanorods were obtained.

Subsequently, the CeO2 nanorods was dissolved into 5 mM H2TCPP solution (pH = 8) was treated to an ultrasonic water bath for 1.5 h. The sample (H2TCPP–CeO2) was washed with NaOH solution (pH = 8) and dried at room temperature in air. The target product was successfully obtained and studied in the subsequent experiment.

The morphology and size distribution of the nanorods were imaged by transmission electron microscope (TEM JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan). The crystal structures of the products were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (D/Max2500PC, Rigaku, Japan). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were taken in KBr pressed pellets on a NICOLET 380 FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet Thermo, USA). UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded on a MAPADA UV-3200PC spectrophotometer (Shanghai, China). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a PHI Quantera SXM spectrometer with an Al Kα = 280.00 eV excitation source, and binding energies were calibrated by referencing the C1s peak (284.5 eV) to reduce the sample charge effect."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 100 nm CeO2 nanoparticles. However, it does describe the preparation of CeO2 nanorods and H2TCPP–CeO2 nanocomposites.

The CeO2 nanorods were prepared using a hydrothermal method. Cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O) was rapidly added to a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution and stirred for approximately 10 minutes. The suspension was then transferred into a 25 ml Teflon-lined autoclave, which was heated at 250 °C for 3 hours. The system was then allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The final product was washed with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C for 12 hours to obtain the CeO2 nanorods.

The synthesis of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter of approximately 590 nm is described in the article. The Fe3O4 hollow NPs were prepared through a modified solvothermal reaction. 

The reagents used for the synthesis included 0.8 g of iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O) and 2.0 g of ammonium acetate (NH4Ac). These were dissolved in 40 mL of ethylene glycol with vigorous stirring. Then, 1.0 mL of N,N,N,N-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) was added to the mixture. The mixture was stirred vigorously for 2 hours to form a homogeneous yellow solution.

This solution was then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with a 50 mL capacity. The autoclave was heated to 200 °C and maintained at this temperature for 10 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the dark product was collected and rinsed with ethanol several times. The product was then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight for further experiments.

The resulting Fe3O4 NPs showed a regular spherical shape with an average diameter of 590 nm. An obvious hollow structure was observed in the Fe3O4 NPs, which was further identified by high magnified transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images.

In summary, the synthesis of Fe3O4 NPs involves a solvothermal reaction using iron(III) chloride hexahydrate, ammonium acetate, ethylene glycol, and N,N,N,N-tetramethylethylenediamine.

The synthesis of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) of different sizes, including 6 nm, was achieved using the solution combustion method. This method involved varying the concentration of the oxidizer (cerium nitrate hexahydrate) and fuel (glycine). 

The specific materials used for the synthesis included cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce (NO3)3. 6H2O, Himedia) and glycine (H2NCH2CO2H, Fisher Scientific). The process began with a 100 mL aqueous solution of cerium nitrate (1 M) and glycine (0.6 M). 

The X-ray diffraction pattern of the synthesized cerium oxide nanoparticles was obtained using different fuel-oxidizer ratios (Φ = 0.6 and 1.1). The peaks obtained for CNP-6 were found to be broader in comparison to CNP-12. The mean crystallite size and lattice strain were estimated using the Williamson-Hall equation. 

When the fuel-oxidizer ratio increased, the adiabatic flame temperature in the combustion process also increased. As a result, a mean crystallite size of 6 nm and 12 nm was obtained at a low fuel ratio (Φ = 0.6) and high fuel ratio (Φ = 1.1), respectively. 

The scanning electron micrograph of the as-prepared cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNP-6 and CNP-12) was obtained, showing the presence of agglomerated, porous cerium oxide structure. The porous structure in the combustion method arose from the liberation of large amounts of gases like nitrogen and carbon dioxide. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of cerium oxide nanoparticles of different sizes, including 6 nm, was achieved by varying the concentration of the oxidizer and fuel in the solution combustion method. The size of the nanoparticles was controlled by adjusting the fuel-oxidizer ratio, with a lower ratio resulting in smaller nanoparticles. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs), including the 12 nm size. It does not mention the specific reagents, equipment, or mmols used in the synthesis process. The article mainly focuses on the characterization and analysis of the synthesized nanoparticles, rather than the synthesis process itself. 

The article does mention that the cerium oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by a solution combustion method with different fuel-oxidizer ratios (Φ = 0.6 and 1.1). The X-ray diffraction pattern of these nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 1. The peaks located at 28.5°, 33.1°, 47.5°, 56.2° and 59.3° correspond to (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) of cubic fluorite cerium oxide crystallographic planes (ICDD card no. 00-34-0394), respectively. 

The mean crystallite size and lattice strain was estimated using the Williamson-Hall equation. When the fuel-oxidizer ratio increases, the adiabatic flame temperature in the combustion process also increases. Thus, a mean crystallite size of 6 nm and 12 nm was obtained at a low fuel ratio (Φ = 0.6) and high fuel ratio (Φ = 1.1), respectively. 

The scanning electron micrograph of the as-prepared cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNP-6 and CNP-12) is shown in Fig. 2 along with EDAX spectra. The SEM image shows the presence of agglomerated, porous cerium oxide structure. The porous structure in combustion method arise from the liberation of large amount of gases like nitrogen and carbon dioxide. However, depending on the fuel-oxidizer ratio, the amount of heat energy and volume of gases evolved in the combustion process varies. 

In conclusion, while the article provides some information on the characterization and analysis of the synthesized cerium oxide nanoparticles, it does not provide specific details on the synthesis process itself, including the specific reagents, equipment, or mmols used."

The synthesis of water-soluble cupric oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) of approximately 6 nm in size was achieved via a quick-precipitation method. The reagents used for this process were cupric acetate, sodium hydroxide, and glacial acetic acid. 

Initially, 150 ml of 0.02 M copper acetate aqueous solution was mixed with 0.5 ml glacial acetic acid in a round-bottomed flask equipped with a refluxing device. The solution was heated to boiling with vigorous stirring. Then, 10 ml of 0.04 g ml-1 NaOH aqueous solution was rapidly added into the above boiling solution, where a large amount of black precipitate was immediately formed. 

The precipitate was then centrifuged, washed three times with absolute ethanol, and dried in air at room temperature. The morphology and size distribution of the nanoparticles were studied by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) of Tacnai-12 (Philip, Netherlands). The crystal phase was investigated by X’Pert Pro MPD X-ray diffractometer (Panalytical, Netherlands). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were taken in KBr pressed pellets on an AVATR 330 FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet Thermo, USA).

The average size of the CuO nanoparticles was estimated from the diffraction peak (200/111) by using the Scherer formula as about 6 nm. The TEM image reveals that the product consists of spherical particles with a regular morphology and a significantly narrow size distribution. The average particle diameter is found to be approximately 6.3 ± 0.7 nm, which is in good agreement with that estimated by the Scherer formula from an XRD result.

The FTIR spectrum of the as-prepared CuO nanoparticles presented high frequency modes at about 585, 535, and 480 cm-1 which can be assigned to the vibrations of Cu(II)–O. The frequency mode due to Cu2O at about 610 cm-1 is not seen, which further proves that the as-prepared nanoparticles comprise of a purely CuO phase, without any trace of Cu2O being present. 

The UV-vis absorption spectrum was used in order to resolve the excitonic or interband transitions of the CuO nanoparticles. The absorption peak of the CuO nanoparticles dispersed in distilled water is at about 280 nm. The band gap of the as-prepared CuO nanoparticles is estimated to be 3.11 eV from the UV-vis absorption spectrum, which is larger than the reported value for bulk CuO (Eg = 1.85 eV). The increased band gap is attributed to the quantum size effects for semiconductors when the particles become comparable to the de Broglie wavelength of a charge carrier."

The synthesis of porous CuO micro-/nanostructures was carried out using a precursor route previously reported by the group. The chemicals used in the experiment were of analytical reagent grade and were used as received without further purification. The chemicals included 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, copper nitrate, urea, hydrogen peroxide, sodium acetate, and acetic acid, all of which were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Deionized water was also used in the experiment.

In the synthesis process, 2.3 g of Cu(NO3)2•3H2O and 1.7 g of CO(NH2)2 were orderly dissolved into 25 mL of distilled water. The obtained mixture was then vigorously stirred for 30 min and then sealed into a 30 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was heated to 180 ℃ and maintained at that temperature for 5 h. The as-formed precipitate, Cu2(OH)2CO3 precursor, was separated by centrifugation, washed with distilled water and ethanol for several times, and dried in vacuum. Control experiment shows that the Cu2(OH)2CO3 precursor can be obtained with reaction time of 5－12 h. 

Porous CuO micro-/nanostructures were obtained by further calcining the precursor in air at 450 ℃ for 4 h. The morphology and size of the product were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, H-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2100). UV-vis spectra were obtained on a UV-3000 spectrophotometer. The electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement was performed on an EMX-10/12 electron-spin resonance spectrometer. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the CuO sample was tested using an ASAP 2010 sorption analyzer.

The article does not specify the exact size of the nanoparticles synthesized, but it mentions that the porous structural feature with pores size of 20－30 nm was observed in the SEM and TEM images of the obtained CuO sample. The BET investigation of the CuO product provides a surface area of about 18 m2/g, with main pore size of about 20 nm and pore volume of 0.13 cm3/g. This is consistent with the TEM observation. The surface area is quite larger than that of commercial CuO powder (ca. 0.1 m2/g)."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 500 nm MnO2 nanoparticles (NPs). However, it does describe the synthesis of MnO2 nanowires (NWs) using genetically engineered M13 filamentous phages as biotemplates. 

The genetically engineered M13 filamentous phages were prepared according to previous work. Briefly, tetraglutamine (-EEEE) and tetraarginine (-RRRR) were respectively displayed on the N-terminus of the pVIII protein on M13 (producing so-called M13-E4 and M13-R4). Then, the engineered M13 was amplified by superinfection of helper phage M13KO7 and purified facilely with PEG/NaCl.

To prepare one-dimensional MnO2 NWs, the genetically engineered M13 filamentous phages were used as biotemplates. After incubation of M13 with Mn2+, MnO2 crystals were generated on phage scaffolds by the spontaneous oxidation of Mn2+ in alkaline solution at room temperature. MnO2 nanocrystals were uniformly mineralized along the length of the phage and the mineralized phages remained the filamentous morphology with the diameter of 30−60 nm. The proposed synthesis strategy is green, facile, and efficient. The nanostructure of MnO2 NWs can be manipulated by controlling the reaction conditions. However, the nucleation and growth of MnO2 at 4 °C resulted in the assembly of discrete NPs on the phage scaffolds, suggesting the significance of synthesis temperature.

The chemicals and materials used in the synthesis include M13KO7 helper, polyethylene glycol (PEG), manganese acetate (MnAc2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%), and glucose. These were purchased from various suppliers. All other reagents were of the analytical grade and all aqueous solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm).

The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments were conducted using a Bruker A300 EPR spectrometer operating in the X-band (9.842 GHz) at room temperature. For hydroxyl radical (•OH) detection under various conditions, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was used to trap •OH to form the spin adduct DMPO/•OH. The H2O2 solution was mixed with DMPO in acidic buffer (pH 4.0) and was detected after the addition of MnO2 NWs or control solutions.

In conclusion, while the article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 500 nm MnO2 NPs, it does provide a detailed methodology for the synthesis of MnO2 NWs using genetically engineered M13 filamentous phages as biotemplates."

The synthesis of MnO2 NFs (nanoflakes) was achieved through a BSA-directed synthesis method. In this process, MnO2 crystals were nucleated and formed by the wet-chemistry method, where Mn2+ was spontaneously oxidized into MnO2 crystals in the alkaline solution in air and BSA served as the skeleton of nucleation and the stabilizer of MnO2 crystals. 

To obtain 2D morphology, the concentration of manganese ion was adjusted. When the concentration of manganese ion was moderate (2 × 10−3 m), the MnO2 NFs with small size (about 50 nm) and thin thickness were obtained. The atomic force microscope (AFM) image of MnO2 NFs illustrated that the thickness of MnO2 NFs was about 3 nm. 

The influence of BSA dosage on morphology was also studied. With the increase of the dosage of BSA (from 0.1 to 1 mg), the lateral dimension of NFs decreased from above 200 nm to about 50 nm. For the excessive dosage of BSA, no MnO2 precipitates formed and only transparent solution was obtained. Meanwhile, the irregular flocculent morphology appeared, probably because the excessive dosage of BSA provided superabundant nucleation sites and restricted the aggregation of MnO2 crystals. 

To confirm the formation of MnO2, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data of typical products were recorded. By deconvolution of Mn 2p peaks, the peaks were fitted into one 2p 1/2 peak at 653.9 eV and two 2p 3/2 peaks at 643.4 and 642.2 eV, which accorded well with XPS patterns of MnO2 and testified that MnO2 was the only existing form of the manganese in NFs. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of MnO2 NFs was achieved through a BSA-directed synthesis method, with the concentration of manganese ion and the dosage of BSA being key factors in controlling the size and morphology of the resulting NFs. The formation of MnO2 was confirmed through XPS analysis."

The synthesis of MnO2 NFs (nanoflakes) with a size of about 50 nm was achieved through a BSA-directed synthesis method. The synthesis process involved the chemical precipitation of MnO2 crystals in an alkaline solution containing BSA. Specifically, BSA (1 mg) was added into a MnAc2 aqueous solution (10 mL, 2 × 10−3 m), and the mixture solutions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature to induce the binding between BSA and Mn2+. Subsequently, the pH value of the mixture solution was adjusted to about 10 with NaOH solutions. After reaction for 7 h, the products were centrifuged, washed with water, dried, and stored at 4 °C.

The morphology of the as-prepared materials was researched using various apparatus. The samples for TEM analysis were prepared by drying a drop of aqueous solution of materials on a copper grid and observed by TEM H-7650 (Hitachi, Japan). To characterize the thickness of MnO2 NFs, AFM measurement was conducted on the AFM Multimode 8 (Bruker, Germany) with tapping mode under ambient conditions, and sample was prepared by depositing a dispersed MnO2 NFs aqueous solution onto a freshly cleaved mica surface and allowing it to dry in air. 

The elementary composition and valence state of the materials were researched by drying the materials and analyzing them by XPS ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The ultraviolet–visible absorption spectrum of reaction solution was recorded on spectrophotometer UV-1800 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Zeta potential (ζ) was detected by dynamic light scattering on the Zetasizer Nano ZEN3690 (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK). 

The influence of BSA dosage on morphology was also studied. When the concentration of manganese ion was moderate (2 × 10−3 m), the MnO2 NFs with small size (about 50 nm) and thin thickness were obtained. The atomic force microscope (AFM) image of MnO2 NFs illustrated that the thickness of MnO2 NFs was about 3 nm. With the increase of the dosage of BSA (from 0.1 to 1 mg), the lateral dimension of NFs decreased from above 200 nm to about 50 nm. For the excessive dosage of BSA, no MnO2 precipitates formed and only transparent solution was obtained. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of MnO2 NFs of about 50 nm in size was achieved through a BSA-directed synthesis method, involving the use of specific concentrations of BSA and MnAc2, and specific equipment for analysis and characterization."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 2000 nm V2O5 nanoparticles. However, it does detail the synthesis of V2O5 nanowires, which are a type of nanoparticle. 

The V2O5 nanowires were prepared using a hydrothermal method. For the synthesis of V2O5 nanowires, the water-soluble vanadium (IV) oxosulfate (VOSO4) was oxidized with potassium bromate (KBrO3) by stirring for 30 min at room temperature. After lowering the pH using nitric acid, the reaction was kept at 180 °C for 24 hours. After cooling to room temperature and extensive washing, the dark-yellow precipitate was dried in an oven at 80 °C overnight and analyzed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

The powder XRD pattern of the V2O5 nanowires shows the presence of orthorhombic V2O5 (Shcherbianite, PDF–003–0207). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed freshly synthesized V2O5 nanowires to have a variable size from 500 nm up to several μm in length and 100 nm in width. A high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of such a crystalline nanowire with lattice fringes of 0.516 nm corresponding to orthorhombic V2O5 was also presented. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) indicates single-crystalline behavior. Complementary analytical data on V2O5 nanowires using energy-dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDX) confirmed that only vanadium and oxygen were present.

It's important to note that the size of the nanoparticles can be influenced by the conditions of the synthesis process, such as the reaction time, temperature, and the concentration of the reagents. However, the article does not provide specific details on how to control the size of the nanoparticles to achieve 2000 nm V2O5 nanoparticles."

The synthesis of VOxQDs, or Vanadium Oxide Quantum Dots, was carried out using a one-pot solvothermal method. The precursor used for the synthesis was VCl3. The solvents used in the process were either DI water or ethanol. To achieve VOxQDs with uniform distribution and similar size, the reaction conditions were optimized.

The typical procedure for the synthesis was as follows: Firstly, VCl3 (0.2 g) was added with 20 mL solvent and thoroughly mixed. Secondly, the mixture was subjected to ultrasonic treatment at 200 W power for 15 minutes and then was respectively heated at 120 °C, 140 °C, 160 °C, 180 °C and 200°C for 10 hours, respectively. Then the mixture was cooled naturally and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min. Finally, the VOxQDs were obtained by collecting the supernatant.

The most favorable temperature and solvent for VOxQDs synthesis were found to be 180 °C and ethanol. The average diameter of the VOxQDs was 3.39 ± 0.57 nm, as determined by statistics of the 100 particles. Higher temperature of 200 °C wouldn’t result in the further significant change in particle size and distribution.

The equipment used in the process included a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope instrument for Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), a FS5–TCSPC–1189–0317-A3732–1 spectrophotometer for measuring the PL spectra, and a Mapada UV-1800PC spectrophotometer for recording the UV absorption spectra.

In conclusion, the synthesis of VOxQDs nanoparticles requires VCl3 as a precursor, DI water or ethanol as a solvent, and a temperature of 180 °C for optimal results.

The article does not provide specific instructions for synthesizing 150 nm VO2 nanoparticles. However, it does describe the synthesis of VO2(A) nanoplates under certain conditions. 

The synthesis was performed under mild hydrothermal conditions using a 2.0 M VO(acac)2 solution. The solution was hydrolyzed at 220 C for 24 hours. The phase identity of the product was confirmed by PXRD (Powder X-ray Diffraction). The chemical state and the compositions of the VO2(A) nanoplates were also confirmed by XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy).

The morphology of the VO2(A) nanoplates was observed in the TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) images. The VO2(A) nanostructures were composed of uniformly plate-like nanoparticles with an average width measuring 30–50 nm, length of 100–200 nm, and thickness of 20–30 nm. The TEM image also confirmed the plate-like morphology which is typically 20–40 nm wide and 100–200 nm long, in agreement with SEM observation. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image demonstrated the well-resolved lattice fringes with an interlayer spacing of about 0.60 nm, corresponding to the (110) lattice plane of VO2(A).

To investigate the growth processes of VO2(A) tetragonal crystalline nanoplates, a series of experiments were conducted to track the evolution of morphologies and phases as a function of temperature and time by FESEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope) and PXRD. Temperature played an important role in controlling the size, shape, and crystal structures of the nanoparticles. By varying the hydrothermal synthesis temperature, the nanoparticles exhibited distinctly different shapes and morphologies, which is consistent with the evolution of crystalline structures.

In order to further understand the formation of the VO2(A) phase, in situ PXRD experiments were carried out using different heating rates. It was found that varying heating rate had no effect on the synthesis mechanism. VO2(A) nucleated and grew directly from solution following the complete hydrolysis of VO(acac)2 with no other intermediate phases observed.

However, the article does not provide specific instructions or parameters for synthesizing 150 nm VO2 nanoparticles. Further research and experimentation would be needed to determine the specific conditions required to synthesize VO2 nanoparticles of this size."

In order to elucidate the formation mechanism of the plate-like VO2(A) architecture, time-dependent hydrothermal synthesis experiments were carried out at 220 C. The ex situ PXRD patterns of the phase evolution of the nanocrystals as a function of time were presented. All of the reflections match well with the ICDD pattern for pure VO2(A) with tetragonal symmetry (no. 70-2716), and no intermediate phases or impurities were observed. The absence of intermediate phases was further verified by in situ PXRD experiments. 

In conclusion, while the article does not provide specific instructions for synthesizing 150 nm VO2 nanoparticles, it does provide a detailed description of the synthesis and characterization of VO2(A) nanoplates under certain conditions."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 700 nm VO2 nanoparticles. The research discussed in the article focuses on the synthesis of VO2 (B) nanobelts, not nanoparticles. The nanobelts were fabricated via a simple one-step hydrothermal route. The precursor used for the synthesis was vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2), which was hydrolyzed under hydrothermal treatment. The process was improved by adding an appropriate amount of hydrochloric acid (HCl) into the reaction system, which facilitated the large-scale synthesis of monocrystalline VO2 (B) nanobelts.

The resulting VO2 (B) nanobelts were found to possess intrinsic peroxidase-like activity. The catalysts with excellent affinity to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and 3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) could be used for the colorimetric assay of H2O2 and glucose. The catalytic behavior of VO2 (B) relies heavily on the catalyst concentration and pH. The optimum experimental conditions were designated as pH 5.0 and 10 mg mL1 VO2 (B) nanobelts.

However, the article does not provide specific details about the equipment used, the exact amounts of reagents, or the precise conditions of the experiment, such as temperature and pressure. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a detailed procedure for the synthesis of VO2 nanoparticles based on the information given in the article."

The synthesis of uranium oxide nanoparticles (UO2 NPs) was reported by Cao et al. in 2006, and further developed by Hudry et al. They developed an organic-phase synthesis method for producing size-controlled, nearly monodispersed UO2 nanocrystals. This nonaqueous technique was applied to the synthesis of nano thorium oxide, plutonium oxide, and thorium/uranium mixed oxide nanocrystals. Hydrothermal techniques for nano-sized uranium oxide have also been developed. 

Chen et al., for example, reported a facile hydrothermal route to phase-controlled synthesis of uranium oxide nanostructures with high yield using organic amines as both reducing and structure-directing reagents. They then converted synthesized UO2 particles to porous U3O8 aggregates through calcination at 800 °C for 2 h in air. Shi et al. conducted numerous experiments on uranium oxide synthesis by exploring this method. In one such study, they synthesized porous, three-dimensional hierarchical uranium-containing and uranium oxide microspheres by a simple, template-free hydrothermal method with uranyl nitrate hexahydrate, urea, and glycerol as the uranium source, precipitating agent, and shape-controlling agent, respectively. 

In addition to these methods, the use of ionic liquids (ILs) as templates and reactants for fabricating inorganic materials are also quite interesting. For example, porous inorganic nanomaterials and mesoporous silica have been synthesized successfully with ILs templates. Visser et al. synthesized nanostructured uranium oxides with ellipse- to disk- to star-shaped morphologies using ILs templating agents and a low-temperature synthesis route, and demonstrated that the structure of the ILs has little impact on the final product. 

In this study, the synthesis of uranium oxide nanocrystals with various morphology structures was controlled through a one-step hydrothermal approach with ILs. The porous-hollow nano-UO2 was demonstrated to have highly intrinsic peroxidase-like activity. 

All ionic liquids were purchased from Kekaite Co., Lanzhou, China. Reagent-grade depleted uranyl acetate dehydrate, o-Phenylenediamine (OPD), bovine serum albumin (BSA), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), corn protein, casein phosphopeptides (CPP), lactoalbumin hydrolysate (LH) and collagen protein were purchased from Macklin Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All other chemicals, including hydrazine hydrate and H2O2 were of analytical grade and purchased from KeLong Reagent Co., Chengdu, China. 

The synthesis procedure for UO2 nanocrystals was followed according to the method, control experiments were carried out by adjusting the species of ILs, hydrothermal temperature, hydrothermal time, and precipitating agent (i.e., NaOH, N2H4·H2O, or urea). The peroxidase-like activity of the porous-hollow nano-UO2 was performed at varied temperatures and pH using 4.8 mg·mL−1 with 0.4 mM TMB or OPD and 4.5 mM H2O2 as substrate. The pH of the reaction system was adjusted using 0.2 M acetic acid buffer. The kinetics analysis for the reaction was carried out by recording the absorption spectra in a time-scan mode at 652 nm."

The synthesis of iridium nanoparticles (Ir NPs) was carried out by a simple chemical reduction process. The precursor used was sodium hexachloroiridate(III) hydrate, with ascorbic acid serving as a protecting agent and sodium borohydride as the reducing agent. After heating and stirring at 95 °C for 15 minutes, the resulting homogeneous light brown Ir NPs dispersion was obtained with good stability and reproducibility. 

The obtained Ir NPs were thoroughly characterized by various methods. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicated that the as-prepared Ir NPs showed a narrow size distribution with the average diameter of 2.4 nm. UV-vis spectrum of Ir NPs showed an absorption peak at 280 nm, indicating the formation of Ir NPs. XPS spectra of Ir 4f in Ir NPs were presented in the Fig. S1.† A pair of doublet peaks at 61.0 and 64.0 eV were observed, revealing that Ir in Ir NPs is mostly metallic Ir(0). Furthermore, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) disclosed that the exact concentration of Ir NPs is 25 mg mL−1.

The article does not provide specific details on the quantities of the reagents used in the synthesis process, such as the mmols of sodium hexachloroiridate(III) hydrate, ascorbic acid, and sodium borohydride. However, the process involves heating and stirring the mixture at 95 °C for 15 minutes, which suggests that the reaction conditions are critical for the formation of the Ir NPs. The characterization of the nanoparticles also suggests that the synthesis process was successful in producing nanoparticles with the desired properties."

The synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) was achieved through a coprecipitation method. The reagents used for this process included 2.5 g of iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2·4H2O) and 5 g of iron (III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O), which were dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water. Then, 11 mL of aqueous ammonia solution was added to the solution under constant stirring at 500 rpm at room temperature and mixed for 1 minute. The magnetite nanoparticles were collected using a magnet and washed using deionized water until a neutral pH level was achieved.

The magnetic separation process included repeated stages: Particle deposition by applying a magnetic field, decantation, adding water, and mechanical resuspension of the sediment. The resulting black precipitate was mixed with 100 mL of deionized water and subjected to ultrasonic treatment (30 kHz, 110 W) under constant stirring for 2 hours. The solution of magnetite nanoparticles was then cooled down to room temperature. The ensuing solution of magnetite nanoparticles exhibited magnetic liquid properties, thus, when a magnetic field was applied, the particles did not separate from the water. The mass fraction of magnetite in the resulting colloid solution was 2% wt.

The precipitate was washed with deionized water by magnetic separation to eliminate nonmagnetic by-products and excess of ammonia. The resulting material was dispersed in 15 MOhm deionized water and subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 2 hours. Ultrasonication of the particles in water led to the disintegration of the aggregates formed during the coprecipitation process, and intense hydroxylation of the particle surface. As a result, a black stable colloidal system with a magnetic fluid-like behavior was formed. Dynamic light scattering showed that the solution consisted of monodisperse nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic radius of 35 ± 3 nm. The kinetic stability of the resulting colloidal solution was confirmed by electrophoretic light scattering, which shows that zeta potential was 36 ± 2 mV.

To further study the composition and physical properties, the colloidal solution was dried in a vacuum for several hours to avoid oxidation. The thermogravimetric study revealed that the mass fraction of magnetite nanoparticles in the solution was >2%. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the material corresponded to the crystal phase of magnetite, peaks referred to JCPDS file No. 19-0629. According to the Scherrer equation, the crystallite size was 10.9 nm. The analysis of particles via TEM and SEM proved a narrow particle size distribution with the diameter of crystallites 10 ± 3 nm. Upon solvent removal, MNPs underwent sol-gel transition and formed a mesoporous xerogel matrix with the total surface area of 120 m2/g and a mean pore diameter of 8 nm. Such xerogels were stable in water solutions without any signs of resuspension. The magnetization curve of the material showed superparamagnetic behavior with magnetization up to 78 emu/g at 8 kOe."

The synthesis of Cu2O nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter of around 200 nm was achieved using a facile strategy as described in the article. The process involved the use of sodium hypochlorite as a green oxidant, which oxidized urea to CO2 as a carbon source to prepare the fine-particle crosslinked Cu-precursors. These precursors could then be further reduced by sodium ascorbate into pure Cu2O nanospheres (NPs) with a porous morphology at room temperature.

The study revealed that the introduction of an appropriate amount of MgCl2 into the raw materials could tune the pore sizes and surface area, but had no influence on the phase purity of the resulting Cu2O NPs. The TEM analysis showed that the particles exhibited a distribution with the diameter varying from 150 to 240 nm and mainly concentrated on 200 nm.

The characterization of the synthesized Cu2O NPs was performed using various techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1011, JEOL), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini, Carl Zeiss), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100, JEOL) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were used to characterize the morphologies and structure of the as-synthesized Cu2O. The crystal structure of the as-prepared catalysts was analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8, Germany). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained on a Tensor II FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics, Germany). X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250). BET surface area and pore size measurements were conducted via N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms on a Micro-meritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, NexION 350X, PerkinElmer) was performed to estimate the content of copper and magnesium in the samples.

The study also explored the possible growth mechanism of the Cu2O NPs. Sodium hypochlorite was used as an oxidant to react with urea to produce sodium chloride, CO2, and N2. After adding an appropriate amount of CuCl2 and MgCl2, Cu–Mg-precursors were formed and the gas bubbles produced from the oxidation reaction of sodium hypochlorite and urea were entrained in the precursor, which may facilitate the formation of precursors with a loose structure. The XRD pattern showed that this network-like Cu–Mg-precursor is a mixed crystal phase including Cu2(OH)3 Cl (JCPDS card no. 50-1559), Cu2CO3(OH)2 (JCPDS card no. 41-1390) and Mg2(OH)3Cl (JCPDS card no. 12-0410).

In conclusion, the synthesis of Cu2O NPs with a diameter of around 200 nm was achieved using a simple and economical strategy involving the use of sodium hypochlorite as a green oxidant and urea as a carbon source. The introduction of MgCl2 into the raw materials allowed for the tuning of the pore sizes and surface area of the resulting Cu2O NPs."

The morphology of the Cu2O samples prepared with the precursor in a molar ratio of CuCl2 : MgCl2 = 10 : 1 was firstly investigated by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1011, JEOL), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini, Carl Zeiss), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100, JEOL) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The crystal structure of the as-prepared catalysts was analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8, Germany).

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, NexION 350X, PerkinElmer) was performed to estimate the content of copper and magnesium in the samples.

In order to examine the role of MgCl2 in the microstructure of the Cu2O NPs, Cu2O NPs were synthesized by using the precursor in a molar ratio of CuCl2 : MgCl2 of sole CuCl2, 20 : 1, 10 : 1, and 5 : 1, respectively, while keeping the other conditions constant. The corresponding Cu2O samples are labeled as Cu2O-(sole CuCl2), Cu2O-(20 : 1-Mg), Cu2O-(10 : 1-Mg), and Cu2O-(5 : 1-Mg), respectively. The XRD patterns demonstrate that all final products are pure Cu2O NPs, and no diffraction peaks related to magnesium are observed in the XRD patterns.

The BET surface area and the average pore size of Cu2O-(sole CuCl2) are calculated to be 13.03 m2 g1 and 7.29 nm. Meanwhile, the NPs prepared using the precursor in a molar ratio of CuCl2 : MgCl2 = 5 : 1, Cu2O-(5 : 1-Mg) NPs, show a BET surface area of 21.32 m2 g1 and an average pore diameter of 12.01 nm. These results clearly indicate that introduction of Mg2+ ions into the Cu-precursor has an influence on the porous structure evolution of Cu2O NPs."

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1011, JEOL), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini, Carl Zeiss), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100, JEOL) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were used to characterize the morphologies and structure of the as-synthesized Cu2O. The crystal structure of the as-prepared catalysts was analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8, Germany). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained on a Tensor II FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics, Germany). X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250). BET surface area and pore size measurements were conducted via N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms on a Micro-meritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, NexION 350X, PerkinElmer) was performed to estimate the content of copper and magnesium in the samples.

In conclusion, the synthesis of Cu2O NPs with a diameter of around 200 nm was achieved using a simple and economical strategy involving the use of sodium hypochlorite as a green oxidant and urea as a carbon source. The introduction of MgCl2 into the raw materials allowed for the tuning of the pore sizes and surface area of the resulting Cu2O NPs. The synthesized Cu2O NPs were characterized using a variety of techniques, confirming their morphology, structure, and purity."

The synthesis of ultrasmall RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) was carried out using the solvothermal method. The reagents used in the synthesis included chitosan (CS) and ruthenium(III) chloride trihydrate (RuCl3·3H2O). 

Initially, a solution of CS was prepared by dissolving it in 3% acetic acid to a concentration of 3 mg/mL. Then, RuCl3·3H2O (25 mg) was added to the CS solution (3 mg/mL, 20 mL), and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. This mixed solution was then transferred to a round-bottomed flask.

The flask containing the solution was then subjected to heat at a temperature of 120 °C for a duration of 6 hours. This heating process resulted in the formation of a dark green solution, which was the product of the reaction. 

The resulting solution was then purified by dialysis against distilled water at room temperature for a period of 48 hours. The molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) for the dialysis process was 3500. 

The equipment used in the synthesis process included a round-bottomed flask for the reaction, a stirrer for mixing the reagents, a heating device for the solvothermal process, and a dialysis setup for the purification of the product. 

The article does not specify the exact size of the RuO2 NPs produced in this synthesis process. However, the term ""ultrasmall"" used in the article suggests that the NPs were likely to be in the range of a few nanometers. The exact size and morphology of the NPs can be determined using characterization techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 

In conclusion, the synthesis of ultrasmall RuO2 NPs involved the use of CS and RuCl3·3H2O as reagents, a solvothermal process for the reaction, and dialysis for the purification of the product. The size of the NPs was likely to be in the range of a few nanometers, although the exact size was not specified in the article."

The synthesis of Au/CeO2 CSNPs (nanoparticles) is a two-step process. 

The first step involves the synthesis of Au seed. In this process, 5mL of 5mM HAuCl4.3H2O, 5mL (0.2 M) CTAB and 0.6 mL (0.1M) NaBH4 (ice cold) are added, respectively. HAuCl4 is reduced by NaBH4 and gives a brown color solution. This solution is aged for 4 days and further used to synthesize Au/CeO2 CSNPs.

The second step is the synthesis of Au/CeO2 CSNPs. This process is based on the method reported by Li, Benxia, et al[35] with slight modifications. In brief, 0.6mM of Au seed is re-dispersed into 0.025 M (8mL) CTAB solution followed by 0.8 mL of EDTA-NH3 solution is added to this mixture. (EDTA-NH3 solution is prepared by adding 0.45 mL of 25% NH3 solution by dissolving 10 mM of EDTA in 40 mL of Milli-Q water). Next, 0.6mM of Ce(NO3)3.6H2O solution is added to the above solution. The total volume of solution is adjusted to 10 mL. This solution is mixed by repeated by gentle inversion for 1 min and then kept in an oven at 90° C for 5 hours. The resultant Au/CeO2 CSNPs is centrifuged at 10,000g for 5 min. The precipitate is re-dispersed into 1 mL water for further use.

The characterization of nanoparticles is done using various methods. Absorbance spectra of AuNPs, CeO2 NPs, and Au/CeO2 CSNPs are acquired using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Biotek, Synergy HT spectrophotometer). Zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameters of nanoparticles are carried out using dynamic light scattering measurement (DLS) from Zeta sizer nano (Malvern instruments) using a laser with a wavelength of 633 nm. The size and shape of nanoparticles are analyzed by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with 20-120 kV (JEM1400 plus, JEOL). Samples used for TEM imaging are dialyzed for purification. The Fourier Transformed Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy of AuNPs, CeO2 NPs, and Au/CeO2 CSNPs is carried out by using Spectrum two FT-IR spectrometer (L160000A, PerkinElmer). 

The average particle size of Au/CeO2 CSNPs is ~75 nm. The hydrodynamic size of Au/CeO2 CSNPs was found to be 187.5 nm, ~ 112 nm higher than average particle size distribution obtained from TEM. This could also be ascribed due to the loose agglomeration of Au/CeO2 CSNPs. The zeta potential value of Au/CeO2 CSNPs was measured to be +30.0 mV that is slightly higher than the stable suspension regime of zeta potential values suggesting that these nanostructures are in stable colloidal suspension at relatively physiological pH (7.2). The positive zeta potential values at physiological pH also suggest that the CTAB molecules are adsorbed on surfaces of CeO2 giving them a positive charge."

The ZnCo2O4 nanosheets (NSs) were fabricated according to a previously established strategy with minor modifications. The deep eutectic solvent (DES) was prepared by dissolving 0.28 g of potassium hydroxide (KOH) in 44 g of polyethylene glycol (PEG-200) and stirring for 1 hour at 80 °C. Then, 2 mM of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate [Co(NO3)2⋅6H2O] and 1 mM of zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO3)2⋅6H2O] were dissolved in 5 mL of DES, and mixed well under stirring. After reaction at 80 °C for 2 hours, deionized water (5 mL) was injected into the resulting solution and left to stand for 0.5 hours. 

Finally, white precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed six times with water and ethanol to remove unreacted reagents. After drying in an oven, a white powder was obtained as the final product. The material was characterized by TEM and SEM to observe the morphology and microstructure. The material is ultrathin, corrugated and interlinked with each other to build a sheet-like shape. 

The XRD characteristic peaks appear at 32◦ and 60◦ indicate the crystal nature of ZnCo2O4, which can be ascribed to the (220) and (511) lattice planes. These results prove that this simple method can successfully prepare nano-phase and well-crystalline ZnCo2O4 NSs. 

To investigate the chemistry composition and structure of the synthesized material, ZnCo2O4 was further researched by EDX, XPS and FTIR. The EDX result reveals that the Zn, Co, O and C elements coexist in the sample, the presence of C element probably caused by the remnant of PEG. The results are also proved by the XPS spectrum, the peaks located at 1022 eV, 781 eV and 531 eV should be ascribed to the Zn2p, Co2p and O1s satellite signal, respectively. 

The physical properties of the prepared ZnCo2O4 were observed by TGA. The obtained sample presents high thermal stability and up to about 200 °C. In addition, the morphology of the nanosheets remains intact after two months and has been tested to have excellent catalytic activity.

The synthesis of LaCoO3 nanoparticles (NPs) was carried out using a sol-gel method based on citrate complexation. The reagents used in the synthesis included cobaltous nitrate (Co(NO3)3·6H2O) and lanthanum nitrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O), both of which were used without any further purification. Citric acid (0.004mol) was slowly added to the aqueous solution of Co(NO3)3·6H2O (0.002mol) and La(NO3)3·6H2O (0.002mol). After this process, the mixed solution was stirred at 80 ℃ for 2 hours.

The obtained nitrate-citrate complex gel was then heated at 160 ℃ overnight. After grinding, the obtained solids were calcined in a muffle furnace with a heating rate of 5 ℃· min-1 in air at 400 ℃ for 3 hours, and then at 700 ℃ for 3 hours. The resulting product was LaCoO3 NPs.

The morphology and composition of the synthesized LaCoO3 were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS). The average size of the as-prepared nanoparticles was found to be about 70 nm. The existence of La, Co, and O elements was confirmed by EDS. The crystal structure of the LaCoO3 perovskite was examined using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns recorded on a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5418Å).

The synthesis of LaNiO3 nanoparticles was performed via a conventional sol-gel strategy. Lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (1.5 mmol), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (1.5 mmol), and citric acid (12 mmol) were dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water, followed by adding 1.5 mL of ethylene glycol. The resulting transparent solutions were condensed at 90 °C into a gel under stirring, which were then decomposed at 180 °C for 5 hours to form solid precursors. 

The solid precursors were then decomposed at 400 °C for 2 hours to obtain foam-like precursors via removing the organic components. The precursors were further annealed at 700 °C for 5 hours with a ramp rate of 5 °C/minute to obtain the final LaNiO3 nanoparticles. The obtained LaNiO3 nanoparticles were denoted as LaNiO3-SG. 

In addition, the synthesis of porous LaNiO3 nanocubes was also described. The lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (1.0 mmol), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (1.0 mmol), and glycine (4 mmol) were dissolved in 25 mL of deionized water, followed by the adding 0.3 g of PVP. After stirring for 30 min, the pH of the solution was adjusted to about 7.0 via slowly adding ammonium hydroxide.

The synthesis of LaNiO3 nanoparticles was performed via a conventional sol-gel strategy. Lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (1.5 mmol), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (1.5 mmol), and citric acid (12 mmol) were dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water, followed by adding 1.5 mL of ethylene glycol. The resulting transparent solutions were condensed at 90 °C into a gel under stirring, which were then decomposed at 180 °C for 5 hours to form solid precursors. 

The solid precursors were then decomposed at 400 °C for 2 hours to obtain foam-like precursors via removing the organic components. The precursors were further annealed at 700 °C for 5 hours with a ramp rate of 5 °C/minute to obtain the final LaNiO3 nanoparticles. The obtained LaNiO3 nanoparticles were denoted as LaNiO3-SG. 

For the synthesis of porous LaNiO3 nanocubes, lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (1.0 mmol), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (1.0 mmol), and glycine (4 mmol) were dissolved in 25 mL of deionized water, followed by the adding 0.3 g of PVP. After stirring for 30 min, the pH of the solution was adjusted to about 7.0 via slowly adding ammonium hydroxide. The resulting solution was transferred into a 40 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 24 hours. The resulting product was centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times, which was then dried at 60 °C for overnight.

The synthesis of CeVO4 nanoparticles (NPs) involves a series of steps as described in the article. The precipitates were collected by filtration, washed with Milli-Q water and absolute ethanol several times, and dried at 60 °C in air for 6 hours. The CeVO4 nanorods were obtained and denoted as CeVO4-2 NRs (‘-2’ stands for using 2.0 mmol EDTA).

In addition, other CeVO4 samples with different morphologies were prepared under the same conditions mentioned above except for using different concentration of EDTA, which were denoted as CeVO4-1.5, CeVO4-2.5 and CeVO4-3, respectively. The article does not provide specific details on the initial synthesis process, but it does mention that the process involves the use of different concentrations of EDTA.

The crystal phase and structure of the as-prepared samples were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima IV, Japan) under the following conditions: 40 kV, 30 mA, and graphite-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The microstructure and morphology of the as-prepared samples were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan).

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were determined by an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo ESCALAB 250, USA) equipped with an Al-anode at a total power dissipation of 150 W (15 kV, 10 mA).

The specific surface areas were measured according to Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation via an automatic nitrogen adsorption specific surface and pore size distribution analyzer (NOVA 4000e, Quantachrome Ins., USA) at 77 K after a pretreatment at 473 K for 2 h.

The synthesis of Tb2(MoO4)3 nanoplates, including those of around 300 nm size, is described in the manuscript. The process involves the use of certain reagents and equipment, and follows a specific procedure.

The reagents used for the synthesis include an aqueous solution of Tb(III) nitrate (0.05 M) and a sodium molybdate (0.05 M) aqueous solution. These solutions are mixed under vigorous stirring at room temperatures. After complete mixing of the reagents, the precipitated terbium(III) molybdate is filtered and washed with distilled water three times to remove the soluble ions remaining on the surface of precipitate particles. The obtained precipitate is then washed with absolute ethanol and dried at 80 °C for 4 hours.

The equipment used in the synthesis and characterization of the Tb2(MoO4)3 nanoplates includes a Perkin Elmer Lambda 25 spectrophotometer for UV-visible measurements, and a KYKY-EM 3200 Digital Scanning Electron Microscope for size and morphology characterizations. The morphology and size distribution of the nanostructures are evaluated by Scanning electron microscope. During the SEM measurement, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) is also conducted on the samples. The crystal structures of the products are specified using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns.

The SEM image of the as-prepared Tb2(MoO4)3 nanoplates shows a typical plate-like architecture with uniform diameter. The diameters of the individual nanoplates are in the range of 20−50 nm, and their length is 200−500 nm with a smooth surface and relatively sharp edges. The Tb2(MoO4)3 nanostructures possess folded edges with parallel lines which correspond to the different layers of Tb2(MoO4)3 nanostructures.

The manuscript does not provide specific details on how to control the size of the nanoplates to achieve a specific size such as 300 nm. However, the size of nanoparticles is often controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions, such as the concentration of the reagents, the reaction temperature, and the reaction time. These parameters can be optimized through experimental trials to achieve the desired nanoparticle size."

The synthesis of Tb2(MoO4)3 nanoplates, which can be considered as nanoparticles (NPs), is described in the manuscript. The process involves the use of certain reagents and equipment, and is carried out under specific conditions. However, the manuscript does not provide specific details for the synthesis of 300 nm Tb2(MoO4)3 NPs. 

The preparation of Tb2(MoO4)3 nanoplates was carried out by adding an aqueous solution of Tb(III) nitrate (0.05 M) to the sodium molybdate (0.05 M) aqueous solution under vigorous stirring and at room temperatures. After complete mixing of the reagents to the reactor, the precipitated terbium(III) molybdate was filtered and washed with distilled water three times in order to remove the soluble ions remaining on the surface of precipitate particles. Next, the obtained precipitate was washed with absolute ethanol and dried at 80 °C for 4 h.

The size and morphology of the synthesized Tb2(MoO4)3 nanoplates were characterized using a KYKY-EM 3200 Digital Scanning Electron Microscope (China). The SEM image shows that the diameters of the individual nanoplates were in the range of 20−50 nm, and their length was 200−500 nm with a smooth surface and relatively sharp edges. 

The crystal structures of the products were specified using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Characterization of Tb2(MoO4)3 nanoplates synthesized via precipitation reaction, was conducted through X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRD) to analyze their chemical composition and purity. The XRD patterns of the Tb(III) molybdate nanoplates has been shown in Fig. 1b. The diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of the sample were entirely consistent with a hydrated structure for the Tb(III) molybdate acquired from PC-APD Diffraction software (No.01-084-0087). 

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was also conducted on the samples during the SEM measurement. EDS spectrum indicates that the sample is composed of Tb, Mo and O elements without any other elements, which confirms that the product is free of any impurity.

In conclusion, the manuscript provides a detailed procedure for the synthesis of Tb2(MoO4)3 nanoplates, including the reagents, equipment, and conditions used. However, it does not specify the parameters for the synthesis of 300 nm Tb2(MoO4)3 NPs."

The platinum chloride (H2PtCl66H2O) was heated for 1 hour at 100 °C, and then 1% trisodium citrate was added dropwise. During the reduction of platinum ion, the absorption peaks of platinum ions were monitored at the wavelength range of 200–300 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, USA). 

The Pt nanoparticles were purified using a dialysis membrane (Spectrum Laboratories, USA) with a molecular weight cut-off of 1 KDa. After this, the Pt nanoparticles were lyophilized and stored under vacuum. The image of Pt nanoparticles was observed using a HR-TEM from JEOL Co. (Japan).

The synthesis of Pt NCs (nanoclusters) was carried out in an aqueous solution using a simple reflux reaction. The yeast extract was selected as the template for NC synthesis because it contains many biomolecules, such as amino acids and proteins, which provide abundant active sites that can efficiently bind and reduce metal ions. The aqueous solution of Pt NCs shows a beige color and exhibits a bright blue emission under the irradiation of a UV lamp (365 nm). The emission spectrum of prepared Pt NCs shows a maximum at 448 nm upon excitation at 370 nm.

In a typical synthesis, 4 mL, 20 mM H2PtCl6·6H2O aqueous solution were added to a yeast extract aqueous solution (16 mL, 200 mg). Then the resulting mixture was refluxed for another 12 hours under vigorous stirring at 100 oC. The light yellow reaction solution gradually changed to brown color. After that, the crude products were first purified by centrifugation to remove the precipitate from the supernatant (15000 rpm, 20 min). Another purification step to remove the unreacted small molecule components was performed by ultrafiltration (3k Da pore size Amicon ultracentrifugal filter units) with a cycle at 4000 g for 30 min. After the purification, Pt NCs were stored at 4 oC in the dark and used for the following experiment. The final concentration was calculated to be about 4 mM based on Pt atoms and the weight to volume concentration was about 15 mg/mL.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that as-prepared Pt NCs were mostly spherical in shape and the average size was 3.0 ± 0.3 nm. The crystal lattice fringes of Pt NCs was 0.23 nm (HRTEM, inset in Figure 1b), which corresponds to the (111) lattice plane of Pt crystals. X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) was then performed to investigate the valence states of key elements in our as-prepared Pt NCs. As shown in Figure 1c, the peaks located at 73.2 eV in wide scan survey of XPS correspond to Pt 4f, revealing the presence of Pt.

The zeta-potential of Pt NCs in aqueous solution at room temperature was measured using a CHI 842D workstation (Chenhua, China). The reaction kinetic measurements were performed by using 100 µL of Pt NCs with 500 µM TMB as substrate, or 10 mM H2O2. The reaction solution was diluted to 3 mL by 0.1 M, pH 5.0 PBS (phosphate buffer saline) solution. The each absorbance was recorded at 652 nm in scanning."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 8 nm Au nanoparticles. However, it does describe the synthesis of Au nanoparticles using three different methods, each resulting in nanoparticles with different surface charges. 

For the synthesis of citrate AuNPs, 150 µL of 100 mM HAuCl4 solution was added to 14.85 mL of Milli-Q water and heated until it started refluxing. Then, 1.0 mL of 38.8 mM trisodium citrate was added dropwise with vigorous stirring, and the solution was boiled for 5 minutes until it turned dark red.

For the synthesis of CTAB AuNPs, 5 mL of HAuCl4 (2 mM) aqueous solution was mixed with 5.0 mL (0.2 M) CTAB solution and allowed to mix at 37 °C until the solution developed a dark yellow color. Then, reduction was accomplished by adding 600 µL of ice-cold NaBH4 (0.1 M) dropwise. The vials were stirred vigorously for ~ 24 h and kept occasionally opened to release any evolved hydrogen gas. The suspension was in red color and allowed to age for 5 days. This seed solution was used for the experiment.

For the synthesis of PEG AuNPs, 100 µL of 100 mM HAuCl4 was added to 5.9 mL of Milli-Q water and heated with stirring until it started refluxing. Then it was mixed with 4 mL of PEG solution (325 mg mL−1-PEG 6000 MW.) and allowed to mix for 3 min. 300 µL of NaOH 1% was added dropwise to this solution under vigorous stirring with heating until the transparent solution turned into a ruby red color.

The size of the nanoparticles was measured using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with 120 kV (Jeol, JEM1400 plus) on a carbon-coated copper TEM grid. The zeta potential studies of AuNPs were carried out using dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer Nano-Zs, ZEN3600 Malvern Instruments Ltd) using a laser with a wavelength of 633 nm. The particle size distribution histogram was obtained by measuring the size of 200 individual nanoparticles from 15 different images using the software (image-J)."

The article describes the synthesis of CeO2 nanorods and H2TCPP–CeO2 nanocomposites, but it does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 200 nm CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs). 

The synthesis of CeO2 nanorods was carried out using a two-step method. The first step involved the preparation of CeO2 nanorods. Cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O) was rapidly added to a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution and stirred for approximately 10 minutes. The resulting suspension was transferred into a 25 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 250 °C for 3 hours. The system was then allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The final product was washed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C for 12 hours to obtain CeO2 nanorods.

In the second step, the CeO2 nanorods were functionalized with 5,10,15,20-Tetrakis(4-carboxyl pheyl)-porphyrin (H2TCPP). The CeO2 nanorods were dissolved into a 5 mM H2TCPP solution (pH = 8) and treated in an ultrasonic water bath for 1.5 hours. The sample (H2TCPP–CeO2) was washed with NaOH solution (pH = 8) and dried at room temperature in air to obtain the H2TCPP–CeO2 nanocomposites.

The morphology and size distribution of the nanorods were imaged by transmission electron microscope (TEM JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan). The crystal structures of the products were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (D/Max2500PC, Rigaku, Japan). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were taken in KBr pressed pellets on a NICOLET 380 FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet Thermo, USA). UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded on a MAPADA UV-3200PC spectrophotometer (Shanghai, China). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a PHI Quantera SXM spectrometer with an Al Kα = 280.00 eV excitation source, and binding energies were calibrated by referencing the C1s peak (284.5 eV) to reduce the sample charge effect.

However, the article does not provide specific details on the size of the synthesized CeO2 nanorods or the H2TCPP–CeO2 nanocomposites. The TEM images showed freshly synthesized CeO2 nanorods with a variable size from 24 nm up to several hundred nm in length and average 21 nm in width. The morphologies of H2TCPP–CeO2 nanocomposites were also similar to those of CeO2 nanorods."

The synthesis of CeO2 nanorods, which can be considered as a type of nanoparticles (NPs), is described in the article. The CeO2 nanorods were prepared using a two-step method. 

In the first step, cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O) was used as the starting material. An 8 ml solution of 0.05 M Ce(NO3)3 was rapidly added to an 8 ml solution of 30.0% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This mixture was stirred for approximately 10 minutes. The resulting suspension was then transferred into a 25 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 250 °C for 3 hours. After the system was allowed to cool to room temperature naturally, the final product was washed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C for 12 hours to obtain CeO2 nanorods.

The synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles was carried out according to a modified procedure by Kim et al. The materials used include sodium citrate dihydrate, ferrous chloride tetrahydrate, iron chloride hexahydrate, carboxymethyl dextran (CMD), polylysine (PLL), poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), heparin, and others. 

The unmodified iron oxide nanoparticles (Nnat) were synthesized by preparing a solution containing 0.76 mol/L of ferric chloride and 0.4 mol/L of ferrous chloride (molar ratio of ferric to ferrous was approximately 2:1) in pH 1.7 water under nitrogen protection. The iron solution was then added drop-wise to 1.5 mol/L NaOH under vigorous mechanical stirring. This reaction mixture was gradually heated (1 C/min) to 78 C and held at this temperature for 1 h under stirring and nitrogen protection. After separation of the supernatant with a permanent magnet, the wet solid was treated with 0.01 mol/L HCl and then sonicated for 1 h. The acidified suspension was filtered through 0.45 mm and 0.22 mm membranes. Concentration was then adjusted to 0.7 mg Fe/mL.

For the synthesis of citrate- and glycine-modified iron oxide nanoparticles (Ncit, Ngly), to 200 mL of 1 mg/mL sodium citrate, 200 mL of 0.7 mg Fe/mL iron oxide nanoparticles were added under stirring. The mixture was sonicated for 20 min and then further stirred for 2 hours. After ultrafiltration to remove free sodium citrate, the concentration was adjusted to 0.35 mg Fe/mL. An analogous procedure was used to obtain glycine-modified nanoparticles (Ngly).

Polylysine- and poly(ethyleneimine)-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (NPLL, NPEI) were prepared by adding 100 mL of 1 mg/mL PLL solution to 100 mL of 0.35 mg Fe/mL Ncit under stirring. The mixture was sonicated for 20 min and then further stirred for 2 h. The NPLL product was obtained by removing free PLL via ultrafiltration. An analogous procedure was used to obtain PEI-modified nanoparticles (NPEI).

Carboxymethyl dextran- and heparin-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (NCMD, Nhep) were synthesized by adding 100 mL of 1 mg/mL CMD solution to 100 mL of 0.35 mg Fe/mL Ngly under stirring. The mixture was sonicated for 20 min and then further stirred for 2 h. The NCMD product was obtained by removing free CMD via ultrafiltration. An analogous procedure was used to obtain heparin-modified nanoparticles (Nhep).

The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using a NICOMP 380 ZLS dynamic light scattering (DLS) instrument for size measurements and zeta potential measurements. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was conducted using a JEOL 3011 high-resolution electron microscope. A thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) was employed to determine coating content of nanoparticles. Superparamagnetic properties were assessed at 25 C using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Iron content of nanoparticles was measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)."

The synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) of approximately 40 nm in size was described in the article. The procedure was a modification of a method by Kim et al. 

The materials used for the synthesis included sodium citrate dihydrate, ferrous chloride tetrahydrate, iron chloride hexahydrate, carboxymethyl dextran (CMD), polylysine (PLL), poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), heparin, 3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine, (TMB, KPL), 2,20-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), hydrogen peroxide, b-D-glucose, glucose oxidase (GOx, from Aspergillus niger), and horseradish peroxidase(HRP, Sigma–Aldrich). All these materials were purchased and used as received without further treatment.

The unmodified iron oxide nanoparticles (Nnat) were synthesized by preparing a solution containing 0.76 mol/L of ferric chloride and 0.4 mol/L of ferrous chloride (molar ratio of ferric to ferrous was approximately 2:1) in pH 1.7 water under nitrogen protection. This iron solution was then added drop-wise to 1.5 mol/L NaOH under vigorous mechanical stirring. The reaction mixture was gradually heated (1 C/min) to 78 C and held at this temperature for 1 h under stirring and nitrogen protection. After separation of the supernatant with a permanent magnet, the wet solid was treated with 0.01 mol/L HCl and then sonicated for 1 h. The acidified suspension was filtered through 0.45 mm and 0.22 mm membranes. Concentration was then adjusted to 0.7 mg Fe/mL.

For the synthesis of citrate- and glycine-modified iron oxide nanoparticles (Ncit, Ngly), 200 mL of 1 mg/mL sodium citrate or glycine was added to 200 mL of 0.7 mg Fe/mL iron oxide nanoparticles under stirring. The mixture was sonicated for 20 min and then further stirred for 2 hours. After ultrafiltration to remove free sodium citrate or glycine, the concentration was adjusted to 0.35 mg Fe/mL.

Polylysine- and poly(ethyleneimine)-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (NPLL, NPEI) were prepared by adding 100 mL of 1 mg/mL PLL or PEI solution to 100 mL of 0.35 mg Fe/mL Ncit under stirring. The mixture was sonicated for 20 min and then further stirred for 2 h. The NPLL or NPEI product was obtained by removing free PLL or PEI via ultrafiltration.

The synthesis of iridium nanoparticles (Ir NPs) with an average diameter of 3.5 ± 0.5 nm was achieved through a simple hydrothermal process using Iridium (III) chloride (IrCl3) as a precursor and tannic acid as a stabilizer. The process was carried out in an aqueous solution. 

The detailed procedure is as follows: IrCl3 solution (5.00 mL, 2.0 mM) was added to tannic acid solution (5.00 mL, 2.0 mM) under vigorous stirring. The color of the mixed solution immediately changed into faint yellow, indicating the formation of an Ir-tannic acid complex. After boiling the mixture solution for 30 minutes, freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (1 mL, 0.5 M) was added and the mixture was stirred for 3 hours. The color of the solution changed from faint yellow to deep brown gradually, indicating the formation of the colloid Ir NPs. Finally, the obtained Ir NPs were stored at ambient temperature for use.

The characterization of the Ir NPs was performed using various instruments. Absorption spectra and peroxidase kinetics assay were carried out on a UV–vis spectrophotometer with a 1 cm quartz cuvette (UV-2700, Japan Shimadzu Co., Ltd). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100, Japan electron optics laboratory co., Ltd) was performed at 200 kV to visualize the prepared Ir NPs, and Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the Ir NPs were carried out with JEM-2100 (HR) microscope. The samples for TEM measurement were prepared by slow evaporation of the Ir NPs solution on a carbon film supported by 300-mesh Cu grids. The hydrodynamic diameter of the Ir NPs was measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and the Zeta potential was determined by using the Zeta potential analyzer (Brookhaven instruments Corporation). The oxidation state of iridium and the interaction with tannin acid were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a PHI Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprobe. Phase identification of the Ir NPs were conducted with X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8, Bruker AXS Co., Ltd) using Cu-K radiation source (= 1.54051Å) over the 2 range of 3–90◦. All Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) measurements were carried out using a Bruker EMXplus-10/12 spectrometer at ambient temperature.

The reagents used in the synthesis and characterization of the Ir NPs, including Iridium (III) chloride trihydrate (IrCl3·3H2O), tannic acid, sodium borohydride (NaBH4), were all of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Milli-Q ultrapure water (18.2 M) was used throughout all experiments."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) of 250 nm or other sizes. It mentions a novel starch-assisted gel formation method used for the preparation of carboxyl group-functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles (C-IONPs), but the detailed synthesis procedure, including the exact reagents, their quantities, and the specific steps involved in the synthesis, are not described in the provided text.

The characterization of the synthesized C-IONPs was performed using various techniques. The surface morphology and particle size of C-IONPs were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). A TESCAN MIRA3 FEG-SEM with an in-beam detector was used for SEM analysis, while TEM images were obtained with a JEOL 2100 TEM, operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 KV. The surface composition of the samples was analyzed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectra were recorded using an AXIS Supra photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, UK) with an aluminum anode to produce X-rays [Al Kα (hV = 1486.7 eV)]. 

The hydrodynamic size of C-IONPs was measured by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) using a DynaPro Plate Reader III (Wyatt Technology, CA, USA) at 25 °C, and the results were analyzed by DYNAMICS software (Wyatt Technology). Magnetic measurements were performed using a Mini cryogen-free 5 T system (Cryogenics Ltd. London, UK). The magnetization of the IONPs and C-IONPs was measured using a vibrating-sample magnetometer at room temperature (295 K) with a sensitivity of 10−6 emu and a maximum magnetic field of 5 T. The crystalline structure of the synthesized nanoparticles was characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku CuKα radiation source at 40 kV and 30 mA, within the range of 20−75° at a rate of 1°/min.

However, without the specific details of the synthesis procedure, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer on what is needed for the synthesis of 250 nm or other size Fe2O3 NPs."

The SEM analysis was performed using a TESCAN MIRA3 FEG-SEM with an in-beam detector, while TEM images were obtained with a JEOL 2100 TEM, operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 KV.

The surface composition of the samples was analyzed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectra were recorded using an AXIS Supra photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, UK) with an aluminum anode to produce X-rays [Al Kα (hV = 1486.7 eV)]. All the samples were drop-cast on aluminum foil, which is grounded with the carbon tape to prevent charging. Charge compensation was also used to record the wide and high-resolution data from each sample.

The hydrodynamic size of C-IONPs was measured by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) using a DynaPro Plate Reader III (Wyatt Technology, CA, USA) at 25 °C, and the results were analyzed by DYNAMICS software (Wyatt Technology). Magnetic measurements were performed using a Mini cryogen-free 5 T system (Cryogenics Ltd. London, UK). The magnetization of the IONPs and C-IONPs was measured using a vibrating-sample magnetometer at room temperature (295 K) with a sensitivity of 10−6 emu and a maximum magnetic field of 5 T.

The crystalline structure of the synthesized nanoparticles was characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku CuKα radiation source at 40 kV and 30 mA, within the range of 20−75° at a rate of 1°/min.

The article does not provide specific instructions for synthesizing MnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) of a particular size such as 70 nm. However, it does describe the general process of synthesizing MnOx NPs and MFNPs (MnOx/MnFe2O4 nanopopcorns). 

For the synthesis of MnOx NPs, sodium citrate (100 mM, 200 mL) and KMnO4 (300 mM, 200 mL) were mixed in a 500-mL round-bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser. This mixture was then heated for 12 hours under continuous stirring at 70 °C. The solution color changed to dark brown, indicating the formation of MnOx nanoparticles. The as-synthesized MnOx nanoparticles were then purified via three centrifugation/washing cycles. The purified MnOx NPs were vacuum dried for 24 hours and finally calcined at 300 °C for 6 hours.

For the synthesis of MFNPs, KMnO4 (100300 mM, 200 mL) was mixed with AIC (100 mM, 200 mL) and heated for 12 hours with continuous stirring at 70 °C in a round bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser. The solution color changed to dark brown as a result of the formation of MFNPs. The as-synthesized MFNPs were centrifuged at a relative centrifugation force (RCF) of 10,000 g for 20 minutes and washed thrice with DI water. The synthesized MFNPs with different KMnO4/AIC molar ratio of 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 are referred to MFNPs1:1, MFNPs2:1, and MFNPs3:1, respectively. The purified MFNPs were dried under vacuum for 24 hours, and then the black powder was calcined at 300 °C for 6 hours.

The article does not provide specific details on how to control the size of the nanoparticles. The size of the nanoparticles can be influenced by various factors such as the concentration of the reactants, the temperature, and the duration of the reaction. The article mentions that MnOx NPs have a wide range of particle size (30100 nm) and without any specific shape. The size of the nanoparticles might be controlled by adjusting the parameters of the synthesis process, but the article does not provide specific instructions on how to do this."

The synthesis of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) is described in the provided context. The Fe3O4 NPs were prepared by heating AIC (1.0 g) in a muffle furnace at 300 °C for 6 hours. The specific size of the nanoparticles is not mentioned in the synthesis process, but the FE-SEM image of Fe3O4 NPs shows their sizes in the range of ~20–50 nm. 

After the heating process, the as-synthesized Fe3O4 nanomaterials were then dispersed in ultrapure water (200 mL) and further purified via three centrifugation/washing cycles. The purified Fe3O4 NPs were dried by vacuum drying for 24 hours and stored in airtight containers. 

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the Fe3O4 NPs reveal that all the diffraction bands (2θ) at 30.3°, 35.6°, 41.4°, 53.8°, 57.3°, and 62.8° are ascribed to the (220), (311), (400), (422), (511) and (440) planes, which fits well to the cubic spinel structure of Fe3O4 (JCPDS 19-0629). The very broad band reflects poor crystalline structures formed at low temperature (300 °C).

The context does not provide specific information on the amount of AIC used in mmols, the volume of the muffle furnace, or the speed and duration of the centrifugation/washing cycles. The context also does not specify the type of vacuum dryer used or the conditions under which the nanoparticles were stored. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of Fe3O4 NPs involves heating AIC in a muffle furnace, dispersing the resulting nanomaterials in ultrapure water, purifying the dispersion through centrifugation/washing cycles, and drying the purified nanoparticles by vacuum drying. The resulting Fe3O4 NPs have sizes in the range of ~20–50 nm and a cubic spinel structure."

The synthesis of CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) of varying sizes, including 10 nm, is discussed in the provided text. The synthesis process involves several key parameters, including precursor concentration, reaction temperature, and the use of capping agents like polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP).

The precursor concentration plays a significant role in determining the size of the resultant NPs. As the precursor concentration decreases, the average size of the CeO2 assemblies is significantly reduced. For instance, only 5.6-nm nanoparticles were observed when the precursor concentration was reduced to 13.89 mM. Reducing the precursor concentration comparably decreases the rate constant of cluster-cluster aggregation, which can significantly decrease the average size of assemblies.

The reaction temperature is another pivotal factor in nanocrystal synthesis. Over a temperature range of 120–200 oC, the morphological evolution from a flower to a cube is observed when the solvothermal temperature increases. The products obtained at different reaction temperatures have the same cubic fluorite structure. The statistical results show a significant impact of high temperature on size distribution.

Capping agents like PVP are usually used to direct the growth of nanocrystals and improve their dispersity. In the absence of PVP, the products prepared exhibit the same cubic fluorite structure as the above-mentioned CeO2 nanocrystals. However, they are 9.2-nm CeO2 nanocubes with a disappointed dispersity and size uniformity. Therefore, PVP molecules are indispensable to a high dispersity and perform as a promoter during the formation of nanoflowers.

The synthesis parameters were kept as 55.57 mM precursor concentration reacted at 180 oC for 30 h, except from the absence of PVP. The text does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 10 nm CeO2 NPs, but it can be inferred that adjusting the precursor concentration, reaction temperature, and the presence of PVP can influence the size of the resultant NPs."

In addition, the text mentions the use of DMF as a weak reductant in the synthesis of nanomaterials, where DMF can be transformed into carbamic acid. DMF is supposed to serve as a reductant to reduce CeO2 nanoflowers and then to elevate the concentration of oxygen vacancies. An appropriate temperature as well as higher precursor concentration can effectively increase Ce(Ⅲ) cations. The properly high temperature might promote the reducing process of CeO2, while much higher temperature will result in a significant size increase which might dramatically decrease the concentration of oxygen vacancies.

In conclusion, the synthesis of CeO2 NPs involves a delicate balance of precursor concentration, reaction temperature, and the presence of certain reagents such as PVP and DMF. The size of the resultant NPs can be controlled by adjusting these parameters."

The synthesis of Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) as described in the article was achieved using a hydrothermal method. The reagents used for the synthesis included 0.5 g of Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O, which was dissolved in 25 mL of ethanol. Following this, 2.5 mL of ammonia solution was added under vigorous stirring. 

After stirring for 10 minutes, the obtained suspension was transferred into a 50 mL autoclave. The autoclave was then sealed and kept at a temperature of 150 °C for a duration of 3 hours. After this, the autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature naturally.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 1500 nm CuCo2O4 nanoparticles. The synthesis process described in the article results in CuCo2O4 nanorods with a width of 200-400 nm and a length of 1.0-2.0 μm. The nanorods are formed through a calcination reaction of a bimetal-organic framework (MOF) precursor, specifically Cu/Co-MOF. 

The preparation process of CuCo2O4 nanorods consists of the formation of the bimetal-organic framework and the following transformation from MOF to metal oxides by calcination. The bimetal-organic framework was prepared using the metal ionic Co2+ and Cu2+ as metallic nodes, 2-methylimidazole as ligand and deionized water as solvent through a coprecipitation reaction. The obtained product has a rod-like structure with a smooth surface, and is about 200-500 nm in width and 1.0-3.0 μm in length. 

To investigate the influence of calcination temperatures, the products of Cu/Co MOF were heated at different temperatures and their XRD patterns were recorded. After calcination at 300 ℃, 350 ℃ and 400 ℃, the characteristic diffraction peaks of Cu/Co-MOF totally vanish, and a series of new peaks appear. The calcined products of Cu/Co MOFs at 300 ℃ and 350 ℃ show a series of consistent diffraction peaks belonging to the characteristic crystallite of Co3O4. The peaks at 31.2, 36.9, 38.6, 44.8 and 65.2 are indexed to the crystal plane of (220), (311), (222), (400) and (440), and meanwhile, no second phase exists, which demonstrates that Cu ion can replace the site of Co ion of Co3O4 to form CuCo2O4.

The morphology of CuCo2O4 obtained at 300 ℃ was characterized by SEM and TEM. The calcined sample shows inherited nanorod shape from its precursor, but a slight shrink in size is observed due to the decomposition of organic ligand. In the amplified SEM image, there are numerous dispersed small nanoparticles on the surface of the nanorods, inducing a rough surface not consistent with the smooth surface of their precursors. 

The equipment used in the process includes a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU-8010, Hitach, Japan), a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G220, FEI, USA) and a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEM-2100Plus, JEOL, Japan) for imaging the obtained products. The composition and crystal analysis were confirmed from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns using a multipurpose X-ray diffraction instrument (Empyrean, PANalytical B. V., Holland). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to measure the elemental composition and electronic state on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, USA).

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 60 nm MnCo2O4 nanoparticles. However, it does describe a method for the synthesis of MnCo2O4 submicrospheres, which may be similar in process. 

MnCo2O4 submicrospheres were prepared via a hydrothermal reaction followed by an annealing process. Initially, 1 mmol of manganese sulfate hydrate (MnSO4·H2O) and 2 mmol of cobalt sulfate hydrate (CoSO4·7H2O) were dissolved into 65 mL of ethylene glycol (EG) and 10 mL of distilled water. The mixture was stirred magnetically for an hour to obtain a pink solution, after which 30 mmol NH4HCO3 powder was added slowly. After stirring for another 30 minutes, the resulting homogeneous solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 200 ◦C for 20 hours. 

The precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water and ethanol three times, followed by vacuum drying at 40 ◦C overnight. Finally, the precursor was calcined at 600 ◦C in air for 10 hours with a ramping rate of 2 ◦C min−1 to harvest MnCo2O4 products.

The equipment used in this process included a magnetic stirrer, a stainless-steel autoclave, a centrifuge, a vacuum dryer, and a calcination oven. The reagents used were manganese sulfate hydrate, cobalt sulfate hydrate, ethylene glycol, distilled water, and NH4HCO3. 

Please note that this method was used for the synthesis of MnCo2O4 submicrospheres and not specifically for 60 nm MnCo2O4 nanoparticles. The size of the particles produced may vary depending on the specific conditions and parameters of the experiment, which are not detailed in the article."

The manuscript does not provide specific information on the synthesis of NiCo2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) of 100 nm size. However, it does detail the preparation of NiCo2O4 mesoporous spheres (MS), which may not be the same as nanoparticles. Here is the information provided on the synthesis of NiCo2O4 MS:

In a typical synthesis, Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O (0.5 mmol) and Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O (1 mmol) were dissolved in ethylene glycol (100 mL) under magnetic stirring to get a transparent solution. The solution transferred into a round bottom flask was heated to 195 °C and held the temperature for 0.5 h in an oil bath. After the solution was cooled naturally to room temperature, the sample was collected and washed by centrifugation for several cycles using absolute ethanol and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. 

Then, the NiCo2O4 mesoporous spheres were obtained through calcining the precursor at 300 °C for 5 h with the heating rate of 1°C/min. The chemicals used in this synthesis were purchased from various suppliers: Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O and Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O were purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Chemical Reagent Factory (Tianjin, China), and ethylene glycol was likely of analytical reagent grade, as the manuscript mentions that all other chemicals were of this grade.

The manuscript does not provide any further details on the size or morphology of the NiCo2O4 MS produced in this synthesis. For characterization of the synthesized NiCo2O4 MS, various techniques and equipment were used, including a TU-1900 double beams UV-vis spectrophotometer, a Tecnai G2 F30 for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM Hitachi S-4800) for surface morphology, an X’Pertpro Philips X-ray diffractometer for X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, a PerkinElmer PHI-5702 multi-functional photoelectron spectrometer for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and a JES-FA200 electron spin resonance spectrometer for ESR measurements."

The synthesis of Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) was achieved using a one-step green strategy based on a solution-phase method at room temperature. This method is template-free and surfactant-free. The reagents used in the synthesis include a freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (10 mM) and a clear purple CoCl2 solution (2 mM). The NaBH4 solution was dropwise added into the CoCl2 solution under gentle stirring and further incubation at room temperature overnight.

Upon the addition of the reducing agent NaBH4, the CoCl2 solution rapidly turned grey and produced bubbles, probably due to the reduction of Co2+ to Co and the generation of H2. Subsequently, the grey suspension quickly became black because the newly generated Co was very unstable and could be spontaneously oxidized to CoO swiftly by the dissolved oxygen. Further, some of the black CoO was slowly oxidized to Co2O3 by oxygen, to form Co3O4, indicated by the gradual appearance of a yellowish-brown suspension during continuous stirring at 25 °C for 12 h.

The morphology of the as-synthesized nanostructure was examined by SEM and TEM, which revealed a hierarchical flower-like sphere. The nanospheres were composed of sheets ranging from several nanometers to a dozen nanometers. The formation mechanism of nanoflowers may be because the initial Co3O4 nanosheets have higher surface energy and tend to reduce surface energy during growth, so the nanosheets will further aggregate into spheres. Finally, a graded nanoflower sphere composed of nanosheets is stably formed. The size of Co3O4 nanoflowers is 360 ± 20 nm, indicating that the synthetic method is controllable and reproducible.

The XRD patterns of the synthesized sample can be indexed to the Co2+Co3+2O4. The XPS spectrum was employed to confirm the valence states of the sample, indicating the co-existence of Co and O in the sample. For Co 2p, four fitted peaks can be observed centered at 780.4 eV, 782.0 eV, 795.8 eV, and 797.5 eV, related to Co3+ 2p3/2, Co2+ 2p3/2, Co3+ 2p1/2, and Co2+ 2p1/2, respectively. The O 1s high-resolution spectrum region displays three peaks locating at 530.1 eV (for surface lattice oxygen), 531.2 eV (for oxygen vacancies).

In conclusion, the synthesis of Co3O4 NPs involves a one-step green strategy at room temperature using NaBH4 and CoCl2 solutions, with the resultant NPs exhibiting a hierarchical flower-like sphere morphology and a size of 360 ± 20 nm."

The synthesis of MoO3 nanoparticles (NPs) is described in the provided text. The process involves the controlled catalytic oxidative dissolution of micrometer-sized molybdenum powders. 

To begin with, 10 mL of H2O was added to 1.0 g of molybdenum and stirred well at room temperature. Following this, 10 mL of H2O2 (30%, v/v) and 2 mL of acetic acid (99.5%, v/v) were gently injected into the molybdenum solution. The solution was then stirred until the color changed from black to yellow at 0°C. The reaction mixture was stirred continuously overnight at 37°C. 

The obtained MoO3 NP solution was finally filtered through a 0.22 µm microporous membrane, dialyzed against purified water for 72 hours and stored at 4 °C away from light. 

The characterization of the synthesized MoO3 NPs was performed using various techniques. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were measured on a TecnaiG2 F30 HRTEM (Netherlands, FEI). The TEM image shows that the MoO3 NPs are well dispersed with an average diameter of 2.0-4.0 nm. 

X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy was performed on an X’Pert PRO X-ray powder diffractometer (Netherlands, PANalytical). The XRD spectrum of the MoO3 NPs showed peaks at 12.82°, 25.75°, and 39.06°, which were assigned to the (020), (040), and (060) planes, respectively. 

Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded with an iS50 Fourier transform (FT)-IR spectrophotometer (Thermo). The FT-IR spectrum showed three main peaks at 560, 875, and 984 cm-1, which can be assigned to the bending mode of the Mo-O-Mo entity, the Mo-O-Mo stretching vibration of Mo6+, and the terminal Mo=O bond, respectively. 

The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the MoO3 NPs was collected using a UV-2600 ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). The spectrum exhibits a narrow absorption band between 200 and 300 nm. 

The text does not specify the exact parameters for synthesizing 3 nm MoO3 NPs. However, the described procedure resulted in NPs with an average diameter of 2.0-4.0 nm."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 5 nm or other size cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles (NPs). It does mention the use of different methods and materials for the synthesis of polymer-coated cerium oxide nanoparticles, but it does not provide specific quantities, equipment, or step-by-step procedures. 

The article mentions two methods for synthesizing polymer-coated cerium oxide nanoparticles: an in situ procedure and a stepwise method. In the in situ procedure, the polymer is present in solution at the time of the initial formation of the cerium oxide nanocrystals. This influences both the nucleation and the growth of the initial nanocrystal, resulting in nanoparticles with a small nanocrystal core surrounded by a thin polymeric coating. 

In the stepwise method, the polymer is added at a specific time after the initial formation of the nanocrystals. This method has been reported for the synthesis of polymer-coated iron oxide nanoparticles and yielded nanoparticles with a thicker polymer coating than those from the in situ process. 

The article also mentions the use of different polymers for the synthesis of the nanoparticles. Dextran (10 kDa) was used for the synthesis of dextran-coated nanoceria (DNC), while poly(acrylic acid) (1.8 kDa) was used for the synthesis of poly(acrylic acid)-coated nanoceria (PNC). The use of a polymer with a smaller molecular weight in the synthesis of polymer-coated nanoceria allows the formation of nanoparticles with an even thinner coating than those obtained with dextran using either the in situ or the stepwise method.

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 12 nm cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs). It mentions the use of a stepwise method for the synthesis of dextran-coated nanoceria (DNC) and poly(acrylic acid)-coated nanoceria (PNC), but it does not provide specific parameters, equipment, or reagent quantities used in the process. 

The article states that the DNC preparation was synthesized by an in situ procedure, in which the dextran (10 kDa) is present in solution at the time of the initial formation of the cerium oxide nanocrystals. This results in nanoparticles with a small nanocrystal core surrounded by a thin polymeric coating. For DNC, nanoparticles with a cerium oxide core of 4 nm surrounded by a thin coating of dextran for a total nanoparticle size (hydrodynamic diameter) of 14 nm were obtained.

A stepwise procedure, in which the polymer is added at a specific time after initial formation of the nanocrystals, can be adopted for the synthesis of nanoceria. This method has been reported for the synthesis of polymer-coated iron oxide nanoparticles and yielded nanoparticles with a thicker polymer coating than those from the in situ process. Using this method, DNC nanoparticles were synthesized with an average hydrodynamic diameter of 100 nm.

Another set of polymer-coated ceria nanoparticles was synthesized using poly(acrylic acid) (1.8 kDa). The use of a polymer with a smaller molecular weight in the synthesis of polymer-coated nanoceria is advantageous, because it allows the formation of nanoparticles with an even thinner coating than those obtained with dextran (10 kDa) using either the in situ or the stepwise method. For the in situ nanoceria preparations coated with poly(acrylic acid) (isPNC), the average hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoparticles was 5 nm; whereas for the stepwise preparation (swPNC), a value of 12 nm was obtained.

The synthesis of MnOx microspheres, which can be considered as nanoparticles (NPs), is described in the article. The process involves a multi-stage, template-assisted protocol using carboxyl functionalized monodisperse-porous polymethacrylate microspheres as the template. 

The first step involves the synthesis of monodisperse-porous poly(methacrylic acid-co-ethylene dimethacrylate), or poly(MAA-co-EDMA), microspheres. This is achieved using poly(glycidyl methacrylate) particles as the seed latex, via a multi-stage microsuspension polymerization. 

For the synthesis of MnOx microspheres, poly(MAA-co-EDMA) microspheres are dispersed in an aqueous KMnO4 solution (25 mL, 20 mg mL1) and the pH is adjusted to 8.0 using 0.5 M NH4OH solution. The medium is stirred at 300 rpm for 24 hours at room temperature for the adsorption of the formed manganese oxide nanoparticles by the template material. HNO3 solution (3.5 mL, 20% w/w) is added and the resulting dispersion is further stirred at 300 rpm for 24 hours at room temperature. 

The polymer/manganese oxide composite microspheres are isolated from the reaction medium by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. The product containing large-size, monodisperse polymer/manganese oxide composite microspheres (ca. 3.7 mm) and small-size sub-micron particles is redispersed within aqueous medium containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (20 mL, 1% w/w) by sonication for 30 seconds (180 W, 50 Hertz). 

The composite microspheres are then dried at 80 1C for 24 hours in a vacuum-oven. For obtaining monodisperse-porous MnOx microspheres by the removal of the polymeric template, the composite microspheres are calcined at temperatures ranging between 380 and 560 1C for 4 hours, in an air atmosphere, with a heating rate of 1 1C min1.

The mean size of the poly(MAA-co-EDMA) microspheres is one of the most important parameters controlling the mean size of the MnOx microspheres. Porous poly(MAA-co-EDMA) microspheres with different mean size values were synthesized by changing the monomer/seed latex ratio in the multistage microsuspension polymerization protocol. 

In these runs, satisfactory overall monomer conversions (i.e. higher than 82% w/w) were obtained. MnOx microspheres in the size range 3.2–5.1 mm were obtained by using poly(MAA-co-EDMA) microspheres in the size range 4.5–7.1 mm. As seen in the article, MnOx microspheres with higher size were obtained by using larger poly(MAA-co-EDMA) microspheres as the starting material. However, no significant change in the porous properties of MnOx microspheres was observed by changing the mean size of the starting material. 

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 4500 nm MnO2 NPs. However, the described method can potentially be adjusted to achieve this size by modifying parameters such as the size of the starting poly(MAA-co-EDMA) microspheres and the conditions of the calcination process."

The template used is carboxyl functionalized monodisperse-porous polymethacrylic acid-co-ethylene dimethacrylate (poly(MAA-co-EDMA)) microspheres, which are 5.3 mm in size.

A centrifugation–decantation protocol involving successive centrifugations at 1000 rpm for 1 or 2 minutes is followed to remove the small-size by-product from the large-size, monodisperse microspheres.

The Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared using a simple hydrothermal method as described in the manuscript. The synthesis process involved several steps and required specific reagents and equipment.

The reagents used for the synthesis included Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O, ethanol, water, and 25% ammonia solution. The chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and used as received. The exact quantity of Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O used was 0.50 g. The solution was prepared using 15 mL of ethanol and 10 mL of water. 2.5 mL of 25% ammonia was added to this solution.

The synthesis process began with the dissolution of 0.50 g of Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O in the solution of ethanol and water. The 25% ammonia was then added drop by drop under vigorous stirring. This mixture was stirred in air for about 10 minutes to form a homogeneous fuscous slurry.

This suspension was then transferred into a 48 mL autoclave, sealed, and maintained at 150 °C for 3 hours. After this, the autoclave was cooled to ambient temperature naturally. The resulting black solid products were separated by centrifugation and washed with water three times. These products were then dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 4 hours, and collected for characterization.

The morphology and size of the synthesized Co3O4 NPs were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SEM images were taken with a SU8000 scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan). TEM measurements were performed on a Hitachi H-800 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherm was obtained at 77 K using ASAP 2020 Physisorption Analyzer (Micromeritics, USA).

The synthesized Co3O4 NPs were found to be uniform and had narrow size distributions. The nanoparticles in the TEM image were squares, indicating that the nanoparticles were nanocubes. The average edge length was about 19 nm. The standard deviation for Co3O4 particle size was ≈4%, excluding agglomerate particles. The surface area of the Co3O4 NPs using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was calculated to about 57.7 m2 g-1."

The synthesis of ultrasmall RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) was carried out using the solvothermal method. The reagents used in the synthesis included chitosan (CS), acetic acid, and ruthenium(III) chloride trihydrate (RuCl3·3H2O). 

Initially, chitosan was dissolved in 3% acetic acid to form a 3 mg/mL solution. Then, 25 mg of RuCl3·3H2O was added to the chitosan solution and stirred for 30 minutes. This mixture was then transferred to a round-bottomed flask. 

The mixed solution was heated to 120 °C for 6 hours. After the heating process, a dark green solution was obtained. This solution was then purified by dialysis with distilled water at room temperature for 48 hours. The molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) for the dialysis process was 3500.

The characterization of the synthesized RuO2NPs was performed using various techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the morphology of the NPs. The elemental concentration of Ru was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The hydrodynamic particle size of the NPs was recorded using a Malvern Zetasizer Nanoseries. UV−vis absorption spectroscopy was used to study the optical properties of the NPs.

The article does not specify the exact size of the synthesized RuO2NPs. However, the term ""ultrasmall"" is used to describe the NPs, suggesting that they are likely to be in the nanometer range. The exact size of the NPs would likely depend on the specific conditions of the synthesis, such as the concentration of the reagents, the temperature, and the duration of the heating process."

The synthesis of Rhodium nanoparticles (RhNPs) was carried out according to the experimental procedure described in a previous work. The RhNPs were synthesized by reducing 0.25 mM of RhCl3·3H2O with 2.5 mM borohydride in the presence of 0.25 mM citrate ions as stabilizers and mixing for 10 min under stirring.

The characterization of RhNPs was performed with Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Dynamic light scattering (DLS). AFM images were obtained in tapping mode with a Multimode Nanoscope 3D using Tap300G silicon cantilevers with a force constant of ≈20–75 N m−1 and tip radius < 10 nm. DLS measurements were performed on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument, using a red laser at 25 °C.

The AFM images show relatively uniform RhNPs without aggregates. Based on the topographical height profile (section analysis) the size of the particles lied between 4.0 and 8.0 nm with an average size of 6.5 nm (depth profile analysis) while the average hydrodynamic diameter of the particles, calculated by DLS, was equal to 9.2 nm.

The concentration of RhNPs was calculated according to the method described previously assuming the complete reduction of RhCl3 and that each nanoparticle has a spherical shape with a uniform face centered cubic (fcc) structure. The molar concentration of RhNPs of 7 nm size was calculated to be 1.4 nmol L−1 which corresponds to 8.4 × 1011 nanoparticles per mL (nps mL−1) of solution."

The synthesis of MoS2 NFs (nanoflakes), which are similar to nanoparticles, is described in the provided text. The MoS2 NFs were synthesized by a simple, one-step hydrothermal route in an ethylene glycol/water mixed solvent. The process began with 13 mg of an unspecified substance being dissolved into 15 mL of an aqueous solution containing 10 mL of ethylene glycol (EG) and 5 mL of deionized water. After stirring for 10 minutes, the solution was poured into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated up to 180 degrees Celsius for 12 hours.

The resulting precipitate was then centrifuged and washed with ethanol and deionized water three times. After washing, the precipitate was lyophilized for further use. The size of the synthesized MoS2 NFs was found to be approximately 390 nm, as shown by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) imaging.

The MoS2 NFs were then modified by PEI, PAA, PVP, and Cys at room temperature. Typically, 10 mg of MoS2 NFs was dispersed in deionized water by sonification for 10 minutes. For PAA modified MoS2 NFs (PAA-MoS2 NFs), 180 mg of 50% PAA solution were added into the MoS2 NFs solution. For PEI (PEI-MoS2 NFs), PVP(PVP-MoS2 NFs), and Cys modified MoS2 NFs (Cys-MoS2 NFs), 90 mg of PVP, PEI, and Cys powders were respectively dissolved into the MoS2 NFs solution. After sonification for another 10 minutes, all the solutions were magnetically stirred for 12 hours in the dark.

The mixtures were then centrifuged and washed with deionized water five times to remove unbounded molecules. The final products were centrifuged and lyophilized for further analysis.

The synthesis of MoS2 NFs (nanoflakes) is described in the provided text. The process begins with 13 mg of an unspecified substance being dissolved into 15 mL of an aqueous solution containing 10 mL of EG (ethylene glycol) and 5 mL of deionized water. This solution is stirred for 10 minutes before being poured into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave is then heated up to 180 degrees Celsius for 12 hours. The resulting precipitate is centrifuged and washed with ethanol and deionized water three times before being lyophilized for further use.

The surface modification of the MoS2 NFs is carried out at room temperature. Typically, 10 mg of MoS2 NFs is dispersed in deionized water by sonification for 10 minutes. For PAA modified MoS2 NFs (PAA-MoS2 NFs), 180 mg of 50% PAA solution are added into the MoS2 NFs solution.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 390 nm MoS2 nanoparticles. However, it does detail the process of synthesizing MoS2 and PEG-MoS2 nanosheets. 

The MoS2 nanosheets were prepared according to a previous method with a slight improvement. Typically, 1g of MoS2 powder was dissolved in 100 mL of N-N dimethyl formamide and sonicated for 24 hours to exfoliate the bulk MoS2 into small single-layer nanosheets. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 20 minutes to remove the unexfoliated MoS2 nanosheets. The supernatant was filtered using a microporous membrane with an aperture of 0.22 µm. Finally, the product was vacuum dried at 80 ℃.

For the synthesis of PEG-MoS2 nanosheets, a two-step method was used. Firstly, LA-PEG was synthesized. Briefly, 500 mg of mPEG-NH2 (MW=5K) and 45 mg of LA were mixed with 2 mL of dichloromethane and 10 mg of DCC, then 6 µL of triethylamine was added. The mixture was reacted at room temperature for one day. Then the reactant liquid was blow-dried with nitrogen to get the solid. Afterward, 10 mL of deionized water was added and the insoluble solids were filtered from the mixture. The pH value of the filtrate was adjusted to 8 by NaHCO3 aqueous solution (0.1M) and extracted three times with dichloromethane. And after that, the organic solvent was evaporated and the product was dissolved in water and the final product was obtained by lyophilization. 

Secondly, the prepared MoS2 nanosheets were dispersed into deionized water by long-time ultrasonication with a final concentration of 1 mg mL-1. 20 mg of LA-PEG was added into 10 mL of the above solution and the mixture was stirring overnight. Then the solution was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min and washed with deionized water to eliminate excess polymer, obtaining PEG-MoS2 nanosheets.

The article provides a detailed procedure for the synthesis of CuO/Pt nanoflowers (CuO/Pt NFs), but it does not specify the size of the nanoparticles produced. Here is the procedure as described in the article:

The reagents used for the synthesis include Cu(NO3)2 ·3H2O, NH3·H2O (25 %), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ethyl alcohol, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and H2PtCl6. These were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Co. (Shanghai, China) and Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemical reagents were analytical grade and used without further purification.

The synthesis process begins with the dispersion of 0.94 g Cu(NO3)2 ·3H2O (25 mL, 0.16 M) and 0.26 g PVP in 20 mL ultrapure water, which is vigorously stirred for 10 min. Then, 0.5 mL NH3·H2O (25 %) and 0.75mL (1 M) sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solution are added to the solution and stirred well. 

Next, 750 μL of H2PtCl6 (40 mM) and ultrapure water (3 mL) are mixed together. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, 2.5 mg with 1.0mL ultrapure water), which is used as the stabilizer, is transferred into the above solution. The mixture is stirred in an ice-water bath for 10 min. Then, 5mL (0.1 M) of AA solution is added into the above mixture dropwise under vigorous stirring. 

The dispersion is then transferred into a 100 mL teflon lined stainless autoclave and sealed, which is maintained at 120 oC for 6 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the crude products are centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant is removed. The final dark brown products are washed three times with ethanol and dried overnight in a vacuum at 80 oC.

The article does not provide specific information on the size of the nanoparticles produced using this method. The size of nanoparticles can often be controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions, such as the concentration of the reagents, the reaction temperature, and the reaction time. However, the article does not provide specific details on how to adjust these parameters to control the size of the CuO/Pt nanoparticles."

The dispersion is then transferred into a 100 mL teflon lined stainless autoclave and sealed, which is maintained at 120 oC for 6 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the crude products are centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant is removed. The final dark brown products are washed three times with ethanol and dried overnight in a vacuum at 80 oC.

The article does not provide specific information on the size of the nanoparticles produced using this method. The size of nanoparticles can often be controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions, such as temperature, reaction time, and the concentration of the reagents, but the article does not provide specific details on how to control the size of the CuO/Pt nanoparticles."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 150 nm Cu(OH)2 nanoparticles (NPs). However, it does describe the process of transforming Cu(OH)2 NPs into hollow multipod Cu(OH)2 superstructures (HMPS). 

In a typical procedure, amorphous Cu(OH)2 NPs and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were mixed by sonication. Then, a certain amount of Cu(NO3)2 and NH3H2O was added to the above solution under vigorous stirring. After stirring at room temperature for 15 minutes, the resulting products were collected by centrifugation. 

On the basis of low-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM), three-dimensional (3D) architectures with an average edge length around 350 nm were formed. High-magnification TEM images further revealed that these architectures are hollow and composed of many tiny branches with the lengths ranging from 150 to 250 nm. 

The crystal phase of the superstructures was attributed to Cu (OH)2 based on the corresponding powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. The observed lattice fringe of 0.263 nm in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image corresponds to the d spacing of the (002) lattice planes in the orthorhombic Cu(OH)2. The ring-type selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern indicates the polycrystalline nature of these hollow multipod Cu(OH)2 superstructures (HMPS). 

To investigate the specific surface area, full nitrogen sorption isotherms of the HMPS were measured. According to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model and the data, the specific surface area of the HMPS was 136 m2 g1.

The formation mechanism of HMPS is illustrated in the article. When the mixture of Cu(NO3)2 and NH3H2O is added to Cu(OH)2 NPs, surface hydrated copper ions coordinate with NH3H2O to generate a complex. However, the generated OH, which has much stronger affinity than NH3 to coordinate with Cu2+ ions, replaces NH3 in the complex to form a chain structure on the particle surface. As a consequence of coordination between OH and Cu2+, the chain structure evolves into a one-dimensional (1D) structure (tiny branches). Meanwhile, Cu2+ migrates from the inner NPs to the surface, leaving a faint cavity in the original NPs and forms tiny branches on the surface. Further increase of the NH3H2O solution resulted in a slight breakage of the tiny branches in the superstructures, in which some branches were dissociated and the cavities were visible at the center."

High-magnification TEM images further revealed that these architectures are hollow and composed of many tiny branches with the lengths ranging from 150 to 250 nm. 

The crystal phase of the superstructures was attributed to Cu (OH)2 (JCPDS card no. 35-0505) based on the corresponding powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern.

The formation mechanism of HMPS is illustrated in Scheme 1 and Fig. S4 (ESI†). When the mixture of Cu(NO3)2 and NH3H2O is added to Cu(OH)2 NPs, surface hydrated copper ions (as [Cu(H2O)6] 2+) coordinate with NH3H2O to generate [Cu(NH3)n] 2+ ([Cu(H2O)6] 2+ + nNH3H2O "" [Cu(NH3)n] 2+ + (n + 6) H2O, NH3H2O""NH4 + + OH) (Fig. S4a, ESI†). However, the generated OH, which has much stronger affinity than NH3 to coordinate with Cu2+ ions, replaces NH3 in [Cu(NH3)n] 2+ to form a chain structure on the particle surface, i.e., [Cu(NH3)n] 2+ - [Cu(NH3)n1(OH)]+ - [Cu(NH3)n2(OH)2] - ... - [Cu(OH)n] (n2) (Fig. S4b, ESI†). As a consequence of coordination between OH and Cu2+, the chain structure in Fig. S4b (ESI†) evolves into a one-dimensional (1D) structure (tiny branches) (Fig. S1c and d, ESI†). Meanwhile, Cu2+ migrates from the inner NPs to the surface, leaving a faint cavity in the original NPs (Fig. S4c, ESI†) and forms tiny branches on the surface. Further increase of the NH3H2O solution to 800 mL resulted in a slight breakage of the tiny branches in the superstructures, in which some branches were dissociated and the cavities were visible at the center (Fig. S1e and f, ESI†)."

The synthesis of citrate-coated Os nanoparticles (citrate-Os NPs) was achieved using a ""green"" and one-pot reaction involving citrate (as a capping agent) and NaBH4 (as a reducing agent). Initially, bare Os NPs without any capping agents under the reduction effect of NaBH4 tend to aggregate easily. To solve this problem, citrate was introduced into the synthesis process of the Os NPs, which greatly improved the colloidal stability of the Os NPs.

The absorbance spectra of the Os4+ and citrate-Os NP solutions were observed. From observation with the naked eye, obvious changes in the color of the Os4+ and citrate-Os NP solutions were observed which may highlight the reaction behavior of Os4+ and the formation of Os0. In detail, the Os4+ solution shows typical absorption peaks at around 220, 255, 340, 370, and 420 nm while a new peak appeared at 260 nm, and other peaks for Os4+ disappeared after reduction induced by NaBH4.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed to demonstrate the morphology of the citrate-Os NPs. The citrate-Os NPs were found to be homodisperse in the solution. The high resolution TEM image disclosed that the as-prepared citrate-Os NPs were particle-like with a lattice fringe spacing around 0.207 nm corresponding to the d-spacing (101) of a standard Os sample (JCPDS card no. 06-0662). The average diameter of the citrate-Os NPs obtained from the TEM images was 1.7 nm adjusted by Gaussian fitting.

Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis results reveal that a large amount of the Os element is distributed on the surface of the citrate-Os NPs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to evaluate the chemical components of the citrate-Os NPs. The XPS results suggest that the Os species of the citrate-Os NPs exist in the states of Os0 and Os4+. The Os0 signals (4f7/2 and 4f5/2) are located at around 51.7 and 54.4 eV, close to those of our reported work. Moreover, Os4+ that forms a chelate or is present on the citrate-Os NPs surface have binding energies of 52.8 and 56.3 eV (4f7/2 and 4f5/2), respectively. Accordingly, the amounts of Os0 and Os4+ were found to be 74.3 and 25.7%. Thus, Os0 occupies the majority of the composition in the citrate-Os NPs."

The synthesis of Cu-CuFe2O4 nanoparticles was achieved through a facile hydrothermal method. The following analytical grade reagents were purchased from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company: Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, CO(NH2)2, ethylene glycol (EG), and other reagents. These reagents were used without further purification. Analytical grade copper (Cu) powder was purchased from Macklin. The solutions were prepared using deionized water.

A homogeneous solution containing 6 mmol of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 3 mmol of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was prepared in 25 mL of EG. Then, 9 mmol of CO(NH2)2 was completely dissolved ultrasonically in the solution. The solution was then transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, heated to 200 °C for 24 hours, and cooled naturally to room temperature. The as-obtained solid sample was separated from the solution by a magnet, washed alternately with water and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C for 20 hours.

The morphology of the sample was determined by transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai-12, Philips, Holland) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN). The phase structure of the sample was analyzed by XRD on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCALAB 250Xi instrument. The Cu content was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) with an Optima 7300 DV instrument.

The specific surface area of the nanozyme is important for the peroxidase-like activity. N2 adsorption–desorption curves were obtained by a specific surface area and pore diameter analyzer (Omnisorp 100 CX). The mean pore diameter was calculated by the BJH method as about 12.5 nm. The BET surface area of the sample is about 70 m2 g−1, which is about 3–5 times higher than that reported for Cu-CuFe2O4 (13 to 21 m2 g−1). This kind of structure assembled by nanoparticles results in a high surface area of the sample. A catalyst with high specific surface area may show high activity. 

In conclusion, nanosheet-structured Cu-CuFe2O4 was facilely synthesized through a one-step solvothermal method. The weight percent of Cu in Cu-CuFe2O4 was determined as 8.5% by ICP-AES. The length of these nanosheets is about 480 nm and the width is in the range of 28–55 nm."

The synthesis of ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru NPs) anchored on porous carbon (PC) was achieved through an in-situ electroless deposition approach, using PC as either a reductant or stabilizer. The PC support shows a three-dimensional honeycomb-like structure enriched in a large number of macropores, which could supply abundant active surface to anchor the metal NPs. The TEM image of PC shows a clean surface, which was decorated with plenty of nanoparticles after electroless deposition, verifying the formation of Ru nanoparticles.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for PC and Ru/PC showed that both samples only have the two carbon characteristic peaks around 25 and 44 degrees, illustrating the deposited Ru NPs in a small size and a fine distribution. This has been solidly demonstrated by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image, in which plenty of Ru NPs in a small size (1.46 nm) are highly dispersed on the surface of PC without obvious aggregation after electroless deposition operation. 

The high-resolution TEM image of one deposited Ru NP shows the lattice fringes with a distance of 2.23 Å, corresponding well with the (111) plane of cubic Ru. This demonstrates that the deposited Ru NPs on PC are the Ru metal crystalline. The achieved sample is further detected by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe the composition and chemical environment. As expected, XPS survey spectrum has the obvious Ru signals as well as carbon signals, and the high-resolution Ru XPS spectrum consists of zero and multivalent Ru singles. This result again corroborates the successful deposition of Ru NPs on PC surface.

Interestingly, it was found that the size of Ru NPs could be controllably adjusted through dedicatedly tuning the reaction temperatures. When the temperature increases from 50 to 90 ℃, the size of Ru NP has a slight increase from 1.53 to 1.86 nm. It should be noted that Ru NP achieved at 25 ℃ has a size of 1.46 nm. The peroxidase mimicking activities of these Ru/PC-T (T represents the reaction temperature) were then evaluated and compared. The results show that the enzyme mimicking activities of Ru/PC has a slight enhancement with the increase of NPs’ size. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of Ru NPs on PC was achieved through an in-situ electroless deposition approach, using PC as a reductant or stabilizer. The size of the Ru NPs could be controlled by adjusting the reaction temperatures. The successful synthesis of ultrafine and highly dispersed Ru NPs on PC was confirmed by various techniques such as XRD, TEM, and XPS."

The article does not provide a detailed procedure for the synthesis of 15 nm Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). However, it mentions that the negatively charged AuNPs used in the study were prepared by the sodium citrate reduction method of one-step addition, a common method for synthesizing AuNPs. The article also mentions that the positively charged AuNPs were prepared according to the authors' previous work, but does not provide specific details in this text.

The characterization of the AuNPs was done using various techniques and instruments. The UV-Visible absorption spectra of the test solutions were scanned by a Hitachi U-3900H UV-Visible Spectrophotometer at room temperature. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of different AuNPs were measured with a JEM-2100 TEM at ambient conditions by deposition of AuNPs solution on copper grids. Zeta potentials of different AuNPs were measured by using a Malvern Zetasizer 2000.

The article also mentions that the negatively charged AuNPs were citrate-coated and had a particle diameter of 15 nm and a concentration of 17 nM. The positively charged AuNPs were modified by an amino group and had a larger average particle size of 20 ± 2.1 nm. The zeta potential of AuNPs wrapped by citrate was −42.3 ± 3.2 mV, while the zeta potential of amino modified AuNPs was +38.6 ± 3.8 mV.

In terms of reagents, the article mentions that Chloroauric acid (HAuCl4·4H2O), sodium citrate, and sodium borohydride were used in the synthesis of AuNPs. These were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). All reagents used in this work were analytical grade and used without further purification. Ultrapure water (18 MΩ cm−1) was used in all experiments.

However, the article does not provide specific details on the quantities of these reagents used or the exact steps of the synthesis process. For a detailed procedure on the synthesis of AuNPs, one would need to refer to the authors' previous work or other literature on the sodium citrate reduction method."

The synthesis of platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) of around 3 nm in size was achieved using polyethyleneimine (PEI) as a stabilizer. The Pt NPs were prepared by mixing PEI solution (pH = 4.0, 1 mg/mL) and K2PtCl4 (2 mM) aqueous solution in PE tubes. PEI was used as the template and NaBH4 was used as the reducing agent. All the tubes were located in a constant temperature metal mixer at 20 °C for 20 min. 

The concentration of PtCl4 2− around nitrogen atoms of the PEI was much higher than that of bulk solution. Then, PtCl4 2− was very quickly reduced to zero-valent Pt atoms by the addition of strong reducing agent NaBH4. These Pt atoms gathered together to Pt NPs which stabilized by PEI. This reduction process was monitored by UV−vis spectra. 

The sizes of Pt NPs for Pt50-PEI, Pt100-PEI, and Pt150-PEI were 3.21 ± 0.87, 3.38 ± 0.74, and 3.7 ± 0.75 nm, respectively. It should be noted that as the molar ratio of K2PtCl4 to PEI increased, the sizes of Pt NPs increased. Thus, Pt NPs had very small sizes with a narrow size distribution. They also had high dispersity without aggregation and high specific surface areas. However, the Pt NPs without stabilization by PEI showed obvious aggregation and big size. Thus, PEI with proper molecular weight was important for the high stability and size control of Pt NPs. 

In short, a facile method of preparation of Ptn-PEI was established, where PEI (70,000) was used to control the size of Pt NPs and enhance the stability of Ptn-PEI. The Ptn-PEI NPs were well dissolved in aqueous solution. The results indicated the successful preparation of Ptn-PEI NPs."

The size of metal NPs has a great impact on their catalytic efficiency. The sizes of prepared Pt NPs stabilized by PEI were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It should be noted that as the molar ratio of K2PtCl4 to PEI increased, the sizes of Pt NPs increased. Thus, Pt NPs had very small sizes with a narrow size distribution.

The synthesis of PVP modified MoS2 nanoparticles (PVP-MoS2 NPs) of approximately 5 nm in size is achieved through a simple hydrothermal route. The materials required for this synthesis include ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24$4H2O, 99%) and thiourea (TU), both purchased from Aladdin Co. Ltd. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw ¼ 58 000), and H2O2 were purchased from Alfa Aesar. All chemicals were used directly without further purification. Deionized water was obtained by an 18.5 MU (SHRO-plus DI) system.

In the synthesis process, 0.5 g of PVP and 0.1766 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24$4H2O were sequentially dissolved into 20 mL of deionized water under stirring. Subsequently, 10 mL of 2 mmol TU aqueous solution was added into the above solution and stirred to form a transparent solution. 

The mixture was then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated to 180 C for 12 hours. The as-obtained sample was centrifuged and washed with methanol and deionized water several times to remove any unreacted precursors and byproducts. 

The characterization of the synthesized PVP-MoS2 NPs was performed using various equipment. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image was determined by the TecnaiG2 T20 U-TWIN transmission electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX, HORIBA EMAX-250). Ultraviolet-Visible-Near Infrared spectroscopy (UV-Vis-NIR, Cary 5000, Agilent, USA) was used for the absorbance measurements. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on the Diamond TG/DTA (Perkin Elmer). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Thermo Fisher iN10-IZ10 spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out with an ESCALab220i-XL spectrometer using a twin-anode Al Ka (1486.6 eV) X-ray source. All the spectra were calibrated to the binding energy of adventitious C1s peak at 284.8 eV. 

The synthesis process and the subsequent characterization confirmed the successful synthesis of PVP-MoS2 NPs with a uniform diameter of 5 nm. The presence of PVP was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The peaks of C–H, C]O, C–N and C–C groups in FT-IR spectrum implies the successful adsorption of PVP onto the surface of MoS2. Thermo￾gravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates 11% of PVP was bound on the surface of PVP-MoS2 NPs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis further reveals more detailed chemical state of the PVP-MoS2."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 2200 nm CuO nanoparticles. However, it does detail the synthesis of CuO nanostructures, specifically CuO nanorods (NRs), which may be of interest. 

The synthesis of CuO NRs was achieved using a solution-based approach. In a typical synthesis, 0.2 M copper chloride (II) dihydrate (CuCl2.2H2O) was first dissolved in 40 mL of deionised (MilliQ) water in a round bottom flask. This mixture was heated to 80 °C and was maintained at this temperature under stirring (500 rpm) conditions. To this mixture, 5 mL of triethylamine was added and stirred continuously for one hour after which the solution was allowed to cool at room temperature. 

The precipitate obtained from this reaction was washed in an acetone: methanol (1:1 v/v) mixture and dried in vacuum to obtain a greyish-black powder. This powder is the CuO NRs. 

The synthesized CuO NRs were then characterized using various techniques. Samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) were prepared by drop coating the samples on a holey carbon TEM grid and holey carbon-coated nickel grid, respectively. The samples were analysed using JEOL 1010 and JEOL 2200FS TEM instruments, operated at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV and 200 kV, respectively. EDX maps and spectra were collected using a JEOL 2200FS TEM instrument in STEM bright field mode with a Bruker detector. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the CuO NRs were obtained using FEI Quanta SEM instrument operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) was obtained using Bruker AXS D4 Endeavour – Wide Angle XRD with Cu Kα radiation (λ: 1.5406 Å). X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out using Thermo K-Alpha XPS.

Please note that the size of the CuO NRs synthesized in this method is not specified in the article. The size of the nanoparticles can be controlled by varying the synthesis conditions, but the specific parameters for obtaining 2200 nm CuO nanoparticles are not provided in this article."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 2200 nm CuO nanoparticles. However, it does detail the synthesis of CuO nanostructures, specifically CuO nanorods (NRs). 

In the synthesis of CuO NRs, a solution-based approach was used. Initially, 0.2 M copper chloride (II) dihydrate (CuCl2.2H2O) was dissolved in 40 mL of deionised (MilliQ) water in a round bottom flask. This mixture was heated to 80 °C and was maintained at this temperature under stirring conditions at 500 rpm. To this mixture, 5 mL of triethylamine was added and stirred continuously for one hour. After this, the solution was allowed to cool at room temperature. The precipitate obtained from this reaction was washed in an acetone: methanol (1:1 v/v) mixture and dried in vacuum to obtain a greyish-black powder.

The synthesized CuO NRs were thoroughly characterized using various techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) were used to prepare samples by drop coating the samples on a holey carbon TEM grid and holey carbon-coated nickel grid, respectively. The samples were analysed using JEOL 1010 and JEOL 2200FS TEM instruments, operated at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV and 200 kV, respectively.

X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out using Thermo K-Alpha XPS.

The CuO NRs were found to have a rod-like morphology with an average length of ca. 2.2 ± 0.67 µm and an average width of ca. 70.1 ± 14.7 nm. The HR-TEM image shows a well-ordered structure with continuous lattice fringes and d-spacing of 1.76 Å, 2.52 Å and 2.86 Å, corresponding to the (020), (002) and (011) planes of the monoclinic symmetry of the CuO crystal. The EDS elemental map suggests that the NRs are composed of Cu and O. The AFM analysis of the NRs further confirms the rod-like morphology of CuO, while the height profile suggests that the NRs are, on an average, approximately 30-35 nm thick. The Bragg reflections obtained from XRD could be perfectly indexed to the standard monoclinic symmetry of CuO (ICDD 45-0937). The absence of peaks corresponding to Cu(OH)2 or other Cu species shows the ability of the synthesis process to produce high purity material."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of Cu-Fe4(Fe(CN)6)3 nanoparticles (NPs), also referred to as Cu@PB NCs in the text. However, it does mention that the PB NCs were synthesized according to a literature reported method, and the Cu nanoparticles were loaded onto PB NCs by reducing Cu(NO3)2 with hydrazine hydrate. The morphology of the Cu@PB NCs was characterized by TEM, and the size of the PB NCs was found to be uniform with an average size of 50 ± 7 nm. Cu nanoparticles, appearing as darker dots in the TEM image, are decorated onto the PB NCs. Elemental mapping data further proved that Cu nanoparticles were well-distributed over the entire PB NCs.

The article also discusses the peroxidase-like activity of Cu@PB NCs. TMB, a typical peroxidase substrate, was selected to characterize the POD-like activity of Cu@PB NCs. In the presence of H2O2, TMB can be oxidized into oxTMB with a maximum absorbance at approximately 652 nm. The absorption intensity of the TMB/H2O2/Cu@PB NCs system has the maximum value at 652 nm. The article also mentions that Cu nanoparticles alone have no peroxidase activity, and PB NCs have a lower POD-like activity than Cu@PB NCs.

The catalytic performance of nanozymes is influenced by many factors, including temperature and pH value. In this work, the optimum pH, temperature, and Cu@PB NCs concentration were studied. The optimum pH and temperature were found to be 3.0 and 35 °C, respectively. With the increased concentration of Cu@PB NCs, the absorbance intensity increased and gradually decreased after 10 μg/mL. Excessive concentration of Cu@PB NCs would lead to a too violent and rapid reaction and a decrease of the absorbance at 652 nm. So the Cu@PB NCs concentration of 10 μg mL−1 was selected.

In conclusion, while the article does not provide a detailed synthesis procedure for Cu-Fe4(Fe(CN)6)3 NPs, it does provide some information on the synthesis and characterization of these nanoparticles."

The long-term storage stability of enzymes is an important parameter. After being stored at room temperature for 3 months, the Cu@PB NCs still maintained 90% of its original activity. In addition, compared with the freshly prepared Cu@PB NCs, the Km of Cu@PB NCs to TMB decreased to 92.3% and the Vmax decreased to 50% after 3 months of storage. The Km of Cu@PB NCs to H2O2 is reduced to 42.2%, and Vmax is reduced to 32.2%.

In conclusion, while the article does not provide a detailed synthesis procedure for Cu@PB NCs, it does provide some information on the synthesis and characterization of these nanoparticles. For a detailed synthesis procedure, one would need to refer to the literature reported method mentioned in the article."

The synthesis of platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) of approximately 1 nm in size was achieved in this study using apoferritin (apoFt) as a nanoreactor. The process involved treating a solution of apoFt with K2PtCl4, adjusting the solution to pH 8.5 to increase the electrostatic interaction between Pt ions and the interior surface of apoFt, and then reducing the Pt ions with NaBH4 to yield zero-valent Pt NPs. 

The detailed procedure is as follows: An apoFt solution (1 mM, 2.5 mL) was mixed with K2PtCl4 (24 mM, 126 mL) and the reaction solution was adjusted to pH 8.5 using 0.2 M NaOH, followed by stirring for 2 h at room temperature. Then a solution of NaBH4 (0.2 M, 150 mL) was added to the mixture and stirred for 3 h at room temperature. To avoid any by-product, the PteFt composite was purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S-300), using deionized water as elution buffer, and the first peak was collected at 280 nm monitored by Ultraviolet Detector.

The TEM images showed that the Pt NPs were largely monodispersed and roughly spherical. Over 90% of the ferritin nanocages contained visible Pt NPs. The Pt NPs have an average diameter of 1.87 ± 0.40 nm as shown in the histogram. High-resolution TEM images indicated a continuous lattice spacing of 0.224 nm, which corresponds to the (111) facet of an fcc Pt crystal. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopies (EDX) confirmed that it was Pt, but not iron in the protein cage. 

In the absence of apoFt, a black amorphous precipitate was observed. In contrast, the PteFt preparation remained a clear, dark brown solution for weeks at room temperature. The platinum 4f electron spectra are shown in Fig. 1g (before reduction) and 1 h (after reduction) by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectra also indicated that PteFt NPs were composed of 74% of Pt0 and 26% of Pt2+. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of Pt NPs of approximately 1 nm in size was successfully achieved using apoFt as a nanoreactor, and the resulting Pt NPs were largely monodispersed and roughly spherical. The process involved treating a solution of apoFt with K2PtCl4, adjusting the solution to pH 8.5, and then reducing the Pt ions with NaBH4. The PteFt composite was then purified by size-exclusion chromatography."

The synthesis of the RuO2 NPs was described in the Experimental Section of the article. A typical synthesis of the RuO2 NPs was as follows: RuCl3 (0.10 g) was dissolved into methanol (25 mL). The solution was stirred magnetically and heated to 50 8C. An aliquot (10 mL) of NaOH (0.50m) in methanol was added dropwise. After the addition of water (25 mL), the reaction mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (200 mL) and annealed at 150–1908C for 10–12 h. 

The RuO2 NPs were collected and purified by multiple centrifugation/decantation/dispersion cycles with methanol, and were dried, overnight, at 100 8C in vacuum. Energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray photon spectroscopic analyses indicated that the NPs are essentially pure RuO2. 

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were performed on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope operated at 200 kV. Kinetics of the catalytic processes were investigated by UV–visible spectrophotometry on a V-570 UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer (JASCO Corp., Japan). Electrochemical experiments were carried out by using a CH Instruments model 660 A electrochemical workstation.

Bioconjugation was done by first coating the RuO2 NPs with 2,2’-bipyridine-4,4’-dicarboxylic acid. Amine-terminated oligonucleotide DPs were then coupled to the carboxyl groups through 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide chemistry.

The article does not specify the exact size of the nanoparticles synthesized using this method, but it does mention that at a constant concentration of RuO2 NPs (2.2 nm) with an average diameter of 4.0 nm and RuO2 density of 6.97 g cm3, the initial rate exhibited saturation kinetics. This suggests that the method could potentially be used to synthesize RuO2 NPs of around 4 nm in size."

The synthesis of Pt50Ag50 nanoparticles (NPs) is described in the article. The process begins with the preparation of Pt/Ag NPs. The molar ratio between the metal precursors of chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate and silver nitrate is adjusted to prepare a series of octahedral PtxAg100–x (0 < x < 100) NPs, where x represents the molar percentage of Pt atoms. For the synthesis of Pt50Ag50 NPs, 122 μL of AgNO3 (0.0492 M), 236.2 μL of H2PtCl6·6H2O (0.0254 M), and 200 μL of HCHO are added to 4 mL of a PAH solution (10 mg·mL–1). This mixture is then stirred vigorously for 10 minutes. 

The resulting homogeneous solution is transferred into a 10-mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The sealed vessel is then heated at 200 °C for 4 hours before it is cooled down to room temperature. The final product is separated by centrifugation, washed with ultrapure water, and then dispersed into 4 mL of ultrapure water to obtain a stock solution.

Porous Pt/Ag NPs are obtained by the chemical dealloying method. Briefly, 1 mL of the stock solution of Pt/Ag NPs is etched with 4 mL of HNO3 solution at room temperature under ultrasonic condition (frequency 40 kHz). When the required etching time is completed, the samples are then immersed in deionized water for several minutes to stop the dealloying process and remove the residual nitric acid.

The article does not specify the exact size of the resulting Pt50Ag50 NPs, but it does mention that the average edge length of the as-prepared Pt75Ag25, Pt50Ag50, and Pt25Ag75 NPs was found to be in the range of 20.9 to 22.1 nm. The size of the NPs can be influenced by factors such as reaction conditions, temperature, and surfactant concentration."

The synthesis of Pt50Ag50 nanoparticles (NPs) involves several steps and requires specific reagents and equipment. The initial preparation of Pt/Ag NPs is achieved by altering the molar ratio between the metal precursors of chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate and silver nitrate. In the synthesis of Pt50Ag50 NPs, 122 μL of AgNO3 (0.0492 M), 236.2 μL of H2PtCl6·6H2O (0.0254 M), and 200 μL of HCHO were added to 4 mL of a PAH solution (10 mg·mL–1), followed by 10 minutes of vigorous stirring.

Briefly, 1 mL of the stock solution of Pt/Ag NPs was etched with 4 mL of HNO3 solution at room temperature under ultrasonic condition (frequency 40 kHz). When the required etching time was completed, the samples were then immersed in deionized water for several minutes to stop the dealloying process and remove the residual nitric acid.

The as-prepared PtxAg100–x (0 < x < 100) octahedra were dealloyed with nitric acid at room temperature for 15 minutes. The products are hereafter referred to as D-Pt75Ag25, D-Pt50Ag50, and D-Pt25Ag75, respectively. The edge length (EL) of products mainly relies on the Pt/Ag octahedra as templates. A typical TEM image of the D-Pt50Ag50 NPs with average EL of 34.5 nm is shown in Fig. 1(a), which displays an octahedron-like shape with a lot of well-defined mesopores.

According to the BET measurements, the surface area of D-Pt50Ag50 NPs is 12.11 ± 0.11 m2·g–1, larger than that of Pt50Ag50 NPs (5.04 ± 0.11 m2·g–1). The mesoporous characteristics can also be more clearly observed in a HRTEM image of a single Pt/Ag porous particle (Fig. 1(b)), owing to its high pore volume fraction (ca. 59% v/v). The crystalline structure of D-Pt50Ag50 was measured by XRD."

The article provides a detailed procedure for the synthesis of Au@PtAg nanostructures, which can be adapted for the synthesis of Au@Pt nanoparticles (NPs) of different sizes. 

The synthesis of gold nanorods (NRs), which serve as the core for the Au@Pt NPs, is carried out via a seed-mediated method. CTAB-capped Au seeds are synthesized by the chemical reduction of HAuCl4 with NaBH4. Specifically, 7.5 mL of CTAB (0.1 M) aqueous solution is mixed with 100 mL of HAuCl4 (24 mM) and diluted with water to 9.4 mL. Then, 0.6 mL of ice-cold NaBH4 (0.01 M) is added with magnetic stirring. After 3 min, the stirring is stopped and the seed solution is kept undisturbed at 30 uC for 2–5 h. The seeds could be used within 2–5 h after preparation.

The growth solution of the Au NRs is prepared, which consists of CTAB (0.1 M, 100 mL), HAuCl4 (25.5 mL, 1.96 mL), AgNO3 (0.01 M, 1.0 mL), H2SO4 (0.1 M, 2 mL), and AA (0.1 M, 0.8 mL). Then 240 mL of seed solution is added to the above growth solution to initiate the growth of the Au NRs. After 12 h, the Au NRs are purified by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 10 min. The precipitate is collected and redispersed in deionized water. The volume used is 100 mL.

For the synthesis of Au@PtAg nanostructures, a PtCl4 22 aqueous solution (2 mM) is prepared as follows: 0.0688 g of K2PtCl4 is dissolved in 2 mL of 0.2 M aqueous HCl solution and then diluted to 100 mL with deionized water. 1 mL of the above Au NR solution is mixed with 23.5 mL of 2 mM PtCl4 22 solution. Then, 5 mL of AA (0.1 M) is added. The mixture is shaken vigorously and placed in a 30 uC water bath. Within 5–6 h, the color of the solution changes from pink-red to gray, suggesting the formation of the Pt shell. The calculated Pt/Au molar ratio is 0.1. The products are denoted as Au@Pt0.1 NRs.

For the synthesis of Au@PtAg nanostructures, the above solution (2 mL) is mixed with different volumes (0, 2, 2.67, 3.2, 4, 5.3, 8, 12, 24, 40 mL) of 10 mM AgNO3 and 40 mL of 2 mM PtCl4 22. The corresponding Ag/Pt ratios are 0, 0.25, 0.33, 0.4, 0.5, 0.67, 1, 1.5, 3 and 5. After that, 8 mL of AA (0.1 M) is added. The mixtures are then shaken vigorously and placed in a 30 uC water bath. Within several minutes, the colors of the solutions change from gray to darker gray. After 1 h, 1 mL of 0.1 M CTAB is added to stabilize the Au@PtAg NRs. The products are purified by centrifugation (12 000 rpm for 10 min). The precipitate is then redispersed in deionized water.

The Au@PtAg nanostructures are then coated with PSS. 1.0 mL of Au@PtAg suspension is purified by centrifugation (12 000 rpm for 5 min). The precipitate is then redispersed in 1.0 mL of water and mixed with 50 mL of 20 mg mL21 PSS solution (containing 60 mM NaCl). The suspension is placed in a 30 uC water bath for at least 3 h. After that, centrifugation (12000 rpm 5 min) is executed once to remove the excess PSS and the precipitate is redispersed in water or buffer solution for further use.

The article does not provide specific details on how to adjust the size of the Au@Pt NPs. However, the size of the nanoparticles can typically be controlled by adjusting the concentration of the reactants, the reaction temperature, and the reaction time."

The synthesis of Au@PtAg nanostructures, including the 60 nm Au@PtAg0.5 nanoparticles, involves several steps as described in the article. 

Firstly, gold nanorods (NRs) are synthesized via a seed-mediated method. CTAB-capped Au seeds are synthesized by the chemical reduction of HAuCl4 with NaBH4. Specifically, 7.5 mL of CTAB (0.1 M) aqueous solution is mixed with 100 mL of HAuCl4 (24 mM) and diluted with water to 9.4 mL. Then, 0.6 mL of ice-cold NaBH4 (0.01 M) is added with magnetic stirring. After 3 min, the stirring is stopped and the seed solution is kept undisturbed at 30 uC for 2–5 h. The seeds could be used within 2–5 h after preparation. 

After that, the growth solution of the Au NRs is prepared, which consists of CTAB (0.1 M, 100 mL), HAuCl4 (25.5 mL, 1.96 mL), AgNO3 (0.01 M, 1.0 mL), H2SO4 (0.1 M, 2 mL), and AA (0.1 M, 0.8 mL). Then 240 mL of seed solution is added to the above growth solution to initiate the growth of the Au NRs. After 12 h, the Au NRs are purified by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 10 min. The precipitate is collected and redispersed in deionized water. The volume used is 100 mL.

For the synthesis of Au@PtAg nanostructures, a PtCl4 22 aqueous solution (2 mM) is prepared as follows: 0.0688 g of K2PtCl4 is dissolved in 2 mL of 0.2 M aqueous HCl solution and then diluted to 100 mL with deionized water. 1 mL of the above Au NR solution is mixed with 23.5 mL of 2 mM PtCl4 22 solution. Then, 5 mL of AA (0.1 M) is added. The mixture is shaken vigorously and placed in a 30 uC water bath. Within 5–6 h, the color of the solution changes from pink-red to gray, suggesting the formation of the Pt shell. The calculated Pt/Au molar ratio is 0.1. The products are denoted as Au@Pt0.1 NRs.

For the synthesis of Au@PtAg nanostructures, the above solution (2 mL) is mixed with different volumes (0, 2, 2.67, 3.2, 4, 5.3, 8, 12, 24, 40 mL) of 10 mM AgNO3 and 40 mL of 2 mM PtCl4 22. The corresponding Ag/Pt ratios are 0, 0.25, 0.33, 0.4, 0.5, 0.67, 1, 1.5, 3 and 5. After that, 8 mL of AA (0.1 M) is added. The mixtures are then shaken vigorously and placed in a 30 uC water bath. Within several minutes, the colors of the solutions change from gray to darker gray. After 1 h, 1 mL of 0.1 M CTAB is added to stabilize the Au@PtAg NRs. The products are purified by centrifugation (12 000 rpm for 10 min). The precipitate is then redispersed in deionized water.

Finally, the Au@PtAg nanostructures are coated with PSS. 1.0 mL of Au@PtAg suspension is purified by centrifugation (12 000 rpm for 5 min). The precipitate is then redispersed in 1.0 mL of water and mixed with 50 mL of 20 mg mL21 PSS solution (containing 60 mM NaCl). The suspension is placed in a 30 uC water bath for at least 3 h.

The synthesis of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) was achieved through a solvothermal method. The specific reagents used in the synthesis included FeCl3·6H2O and CoCl2·6H2O, which were dissolved in ethylene glycol. Sodium acetate (NaAc) was then added to this solution. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 12 by adding NaOH dropwise. 

The mixture was then transferred into a tetrafluoroethylene vessel, which was sealed in a stainless-steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated at a rate of 2 °C/min and maintained at 200 °C for 6 hours. The product of CoFe2O4 was magnetically isolated, followed by being washed twice with absolute ethyl alcohol and thrice with DI water. 

To enhance the biocompatibility and aqueous stability, PEGylation was concurrently realized upon the addition of NH2−PEG3400-COOH as surfactant additive. The PEGylated CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (CFP) were mixed with NH2−PEG3400-COOH (32 μg/mL, 1:1 by weight), and the reaction proceeded under stirring at 25 °C for 24 hours. At last, CFP nanoflowers were magnetically separated and thoroughly washed with DI water prior to any use.

The as-synthesized CFP exhibited well-defined flower-like structure with narrow size distribution, and the average diameter was measured to be 164.8 ± 20.7 nm. The hydrated size of CFP was determined to be ∼280.1 nm through dynamic light scattering (DLS). The crystal structure of CFP matched that of pristine CoFe2O4 from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, indicating a high crystalline purity of CFP but with a bit of crystalline cobalt impurity doping. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed to testify the effective conjugation of PEG onto CoFe2O4. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of CoFe2O4 NPs involves a solvothermal method, the use of specific reagents and conditions, and a PEGylation process for enhancing biocompatibility and aqueous stability. The resulting NPs have a well-defined structure, narrow size distribution, and high crystalline purity."

The PVP/IrPt ANs alloy nanoparticles were synthesized through a refluxing assisted one-pot wet chemical method. Initially, 0.15 mM IrCl3.xH2O, 0.15 mM H2PtCl6.6H2O, and PVP 40 kDa were sequentially mixed with 50 mL of ethylene glycol in a flask. The mixture solution was stirred vigorously for 1 hour at room temperature to ensure homogeneous mixing. 

After this, the mixture was placed in a heating mantle and stirred initially at 100 °C for 2 hours then at 160 °C for 3 hours. In the presence of PVP, the refluxing process results in the simultaneous reduction of the Pt and Ir precursors and the formation of well-dispersed alloy nanoparticles. 

Once the final product was returned to room temperature, it was transferred to dialysis tubing and kept in a beaker containing 5 L of water for 24 hours. The water was repeatedly changed every 4 hours to neutralize the pH and remove impurities. 

For comparison, Pt and Ir nanoparticles were also synthesized using similar methods. The average crystallite size of Ir, Pt, and IrPt ANs were calculated using the Scherrer equation and found to be 1.9 nm, 4.7 nm, and 3.0 nm, respectively. The reduction in crystallite size for IrPt compared to Pt also indicates the formation of IrPt alloys. 

The XRD patterns of the PVP/Ir NPs, PVP/Pt NPs, and PVP/IrPt ANs illustrate their crystalline nature. The XRD pattern of PVP/IrPt ANs did not reveal any individual peaks for Ir, but instead showed a slight red-shift in the reflection position (2u) related to Pt that suggests the formation of bimetallic alloy structures. 

The EDAX spectrum of PVP/IrPt ANs was acquired to confirm the presence of Ir and Pt in the bimetallic system. The acquired atomic percentages of Ir and Pt were 22.35% and 77.65%. Both the XRD and TEM results strongly suggest the formation of bimetallic IrPt ANs."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 850 nm Ag3PO4 nanoparticles. However, it does describe the general method for synthesizing Ag3PO4 nanoparticles. 

The Ag3PO4 nanoparticles were prepared using the ion-exchange method according to a previous study. Specifically, 0.02 mol of NaH2PO4 and 0.06 mol of CH3COOAg were dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water, respectively. The solutions were then mixed under constant stirring for 30 minutes. The resulting yellow precipitate was washed with distilled water and dried at 70 ℃ in an oven to obtain the Ag3PO4 nanoparticles.

The morphology and sizes of the samples were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM 7401F, JEOL, Japan). The crystal phase and structure of the samples were identified by an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, D/MAX 2500, Rigaku, Japan) using a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) and a fixed power source (40.0 kV, 200.0 mA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results were obtained on a JEM 2100 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi). 

The article does not provide specific details on how to control the size of the nanoparticles to 850 nm or any other specific size. The estimated average diameter of the Ag3PO4 nanoparticles as described in the article is between 0.5 and 1.2 µm. The size of the nanoparticles can be influenced by various factors such as the concentration of the reactants, the reaction temperature, and the reaction time, but these parameters are not specified in the article for the synthesis of Ag3PO4 nanoparticles of a specific size."

The synthesis of Prussian blue modified g-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (PBMNPs) of approximately 10 nm size involves several steps and requires various chemicals and equipment. 

Firstly, g-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared. The particle concentration is then diluted to 0.1 mg mL1 and the pH is adjusted to 2.0 with hydrochloric acid. The PBMNPs are prepared by an improved method using the as-synthesized g-Fe2O3 NPs as seeds under stirring, followed by adding dropwise varying amounts of an aqueous solution of 10 mg mL1 K4[Fe(CN)6]$3H2O with different volumes. The resultant mixture is continuously stirred for 1 h and the obtained composites are collected and washed three times by magnetic decantation. In this work, different amounts of K4[Fe(CN)6]$3H2O (1, 1.5, 2.5 mg) are selected to vary the PB content. The resultant PB modified g-Fe2O3 magnetic nanoparticles are denoted as PBMNPs1, PBMNPs2 and PBMNPs3, respectively.

The particle size and morphology of the NPs obtained above are characterized by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis is performed using an infrared spectrometer (Nicolet AVATAR 360 FTIR). Ultraviolet–visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra are measured on an UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600, Japan). The structure and composition are detected by an X’TRA X-ray diffractometer (l ¼ 1.54056 A) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250), respectively. Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) is used to determine the element ratio of iron and nitrogen. Magnetic measurements are carried out with a Lakeshore 7407 vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM).

The article does not provide specific information on the mmols of the reagents used in the synthesis process. However, it does mention that different amounts of K4[Fe(CN)6]$3H2O (1, 1.5, 2.5 mg) are used to vary the PB content in the nanoparticles."

The average size of g-Fe2O3 nanoparticles is about 9.5 nm. After modification with PB, the particles tend to be slightly larger and the size is approximately 9.8, 10 and 10.5 nm for PBMNPs1, PBMNPs2 and PBMNPs3, respectively. This may be due to the modified PB on the surface of g-Fe2O3 nanoparticles but the size increases a little with increasing PB proportion due likely also to the surface decomposition of g-Fe2O3 nanoparticles in the reaction process. The obtained PBMNPs could be stably dispersed in aqueous solution. The average hydrodynamic diameter of PBMNPs was in the range of 120 and 160 nm as characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS)."

The synthesis of ZnFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) was carried out using a hydrothermal method. The reagents used for the synthesis included ZnCl2 (0.34 g, 2.5 mmol) and FeCl3·6H2O (1.35 g, 5 mmol). These were dissolved in ethylene glycol (40 mL) to form a clear solution. Following this, NaAc (3.6 g) and polyethylene glycol 20 000 (1.0 g) were added to the solution. The mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 minutes.

After stirring, the mixture was sealed in a teflonlined stainless-steel autoclave with a 50 mL capacity. The autoclave was then heated to and maintained at 200 °C for 8 hours and allowed to cool to room temperature. The resulting black products were washed several times with ethanol and dried at 60 °C for 6 hours to obtain the ZnFe2O4 MNPs.

The as-prepared ZnFe2O4 MNPs were characterized using various techniques. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of ZnFe2O4 MNPs was carried out with a X’Pertpro Philips X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056). A magnetic hysteresis loop of the prepared ZnFe2O4 MNPs was carried out with a vibration sample magnetometer (VSM, Lakeshore cryotronics 730, USA) at room temperature. Zeta potential measurements of ZnFe2O4 MNPs were performed with a Malvern Nano-ZS apparatus. 

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that ZnFe2O4 MNPs were spherical and dispersive with an average size of about 200 nm. The magnetic property of ZnFe2O4 MNPs was investigated at 298 K using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The magnetization hysteresis loops appeared S-like and the saturation magnetization was 65 emu·g−1. The zeta potential value of ZnFe2O4 MNPs decreased with the increase of pH, and the isoelectrical point (IEP) was about 4.8. The value of zeta potential is 4.92 mV at pH 4.0, suggesting the surface of ZnFe2O4 MNPs has positive charge at the pH."

The synthesis of Fe0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles was carried out using a co-precipitation method under argon atmosphere. The reagents used for the synthesis included ferric chlorides (FeCl3), ferrous sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O), and manganese chloride (MnCl2·4H2O) obtained from Merck, Germany. The synthesis was performed in a 100 ml three-necked flask equipped with argon flow and a mechanical stirrer.

For the synthesis of (Fe0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4) magnetic nanoparticles, 0.324 g of FeCl3, 0.140 g of FeSO4·7H2O and 0.098 g of MnCl2·4H2O were taken in 40 ml of absolutely deoxygenated milli-Q water in the flask. 5 ml of NH3 (25%) solution was added into it dropwise over a period of 15 min during which black precipitates were formed. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 2 h at 70 ◦C. After completion of the reaction, black particles were separated and washed 5 times with milli-Q water using a magnetic concentrator.

For the surface modification of magnetic ferrofluid (Fe0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4) by PMIDA, mixed ferrite nanoparticles and PMIDA were taken in a 1:2 molar ratio in an alkaline medium (pH 8–9). The solution was again sonicated for 20 min and magnetically stirred for 24 h. The particles were separated magnetically, and washed five times with water followed by ethanol and dried in vacuum. Few drops of the suspended particles in water were acidified with dilute acetic acid (pH was maintained 4–5) and further dispersed in 10 ml of millipore water by ultrasonication. The magnetic nanoparticles were recovered from the reaction mixture using a permanent magnet.

The crystallite sizes of Fe1−xMnxFe2O4 (x = 0.15 and 0.5) nanoparticles were calculated from the XRD line (3 1 1) broadening using Scherrer’s formula. The crystallite sizes of the nanoparticles decreased from 10 to 8 nm with increased Mn2+ concentrations from 0.15 to 0.5. The representative TEM micrographs illustrated that the uncoated Fe1−xMnxFe2O4 (x = 0.5 and 0.15) nanoparticles had a particle size in the range of 7–9 nm respectively with a high amount of agglomeration. After modification, the TEM images displayed that the size of the PMIDA–Fe0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 (approximately 10–11 nm) somewhat increased than uncoated particles. This increase was due to the presence of adsorbed phosphonate layer on the mixed ferrite nanoparticles."

The specific amounts of reagents used are 0.324 g of FeCl3, 0.140 g of FeSO4·7H2O, and 0.098 g of MnCl2·4H2O. These are taken in 40 ml of absolutely deoxygenated milli-Q water in a 100 ml three-necked flask equipped with argon flow and a mechanical stirrer.

The synthesized nanoparticles are then characterized using various techniques. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is employed to characterize the microstructure of the nanoparticles. The XRD patterns of the synthesized nanoparticles are also studied to confirm the formation of the desired ferrite system. The hydrodynamic diameters and zeta potentials of the nanoparticles are studied under different pH conditions using dynamic laser light scattering (DLS) measurements.

The synthesis of FeSe nanoparticles (NPs) with an average diameter of 30 nm was achieved through a chemical bath deposition process. The precursor complex used for this process was [Fe3(3-O)(2-O2CCH2Cl)6(H2O)3]NO3·H2O. A glass or ITO substrate was dipped into a stirred 20 mL aqueous solution containing 440 mg (0.5 mmol) of the precursor complex in a 50 mL beaker. To this solution, 20 mL of an aqueous solution of sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) (260 mg, 1.5 mmol) was added dropwise. The red colored solution slowly changed to black. The mixture was then stirred at 85 ◦C. After 10 hours, a gray film was obtained on the glass or ITO substrate with a film thickness of approximately 250 nm, as determined by gravimetric analysis.

The structural characterization of the FeSe NPs was carried out using X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and UV–vis spectroscopic techniques. The XRD patterns of the FeSe film matched quite well with the standard diffraction data of the pure tetragonal phase of FeSe. The FESEM image revealed that the as-obtained FeSe had a spherical morphology with an average diameter of about 30 nm. The UV–vis spectral analysis was carried out at room temperature from 900 to 300 nm using a glass substrate as reference. Sharp rises in absorbances were found to take place near 725 nm for the FeSe film.

The concentrations of iron and selenium ions had to be controlled very carefully during the deposition of the film. This was achieved by using a complex with high stability and a moderately stable selenium source. The water-soluble trinuclear iron core facilitated the slow release of iron ions, thus controlling its concentration. The pH of the aqueous solution of the precursor complex was between 2.5 and 3.0, which is suitable for the deposition of iron chalcogenides.

In conclusion, the synthesis of FeSe NPs with an average diameter of 30 nm was achieved through a chemical bath deposition process using a precursor complex and sodium selenite. The structural characterization confirmed the formation of FeSe NPs with the desired size and morphology."

The particle sizes were somewhat higher than the values obtained from the XRD pattern analysis. The size obtained from the XRD pattern is the grain size, while the size observed from the FESEM image is the particle size. Since one particle may contain one or several grains, the size obtained from the FESEM image can be greater than that calculated from the XRD pattern."

The article describes the synthesis of Iron Selenide (FeSe) and Iron Sulfide (FeS) thin films, not nanoparticles. However, the FeS thin film was found to consist of interconnected monodispersed porous spherical particles with an average diameter of about 40 nm.

The FeS thin film was deposited through a chemical bath deposition process. The precursor complex used was [Fe3(3-O)(2-O2CCH2Cl)6(H2O)3]NO3·H2O. Sodium hyposulfite (Na2S2O3·5H2O) was used as the sulfur source. The concentrations of iron and sulfide ions were controlled very carefully during the deposition of the film.

The pH of the precursor complex's aqueous solution was between 2.5 and 3.0, which is suitable for the deposition of iron chalcogenides.

The deposition of the FeS thin film was carried out in the same way as the FeSe film, except that sodium hyposulfite was used instead of sodium selenite. A properly cleaned glass or ITO substrate was dipped into a stirred 20 mL aqueous solution containing 440 mg (0.5 mmol) precursor complex in a 50 mL beaker. To this solution, 20 mL of an aqueous solution of sodium hyposulfite (260 mg, 1.5 mmol) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred at 85 ◦C.

The XRD patterns matched quite well with the standard diffraction data of the pure tetragonal phase of FeS.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 2500 nm MnSe nanoparticles. However, it does detail the synthesis of α-MnSe crystals, which may be relevant to your inquiry. 

In a typical synthesis of α-MnSe crystals (MnSe-4), 4 mmol of Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O (Mn(Ac)2), 4 mmol of SeO2, 2 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10 mL of glycerol, and 10 mL of N2H4·4H2O (80%) (HZ) were added into 60 mL of water under vigorous stirring condition at room temperature for 10 min. The mixture was then transferred into a teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 oC for 36 h. The final sample was collected by filtration, washed with water and absolute ethanol, and then dried at 60 oC for 24 h in air.

The article also discusses the effect of the starting raw materials on the morphology of the resultant α-MnSe. The use of glycerol can help form a rough surface and reduce the particle size. The morphology of α-MnSe crystals can be easily tailored by adjusting the concentration of SDS and high concentration SDS facilitates the formation of special belt crystals. The particle size of the MnSe-4 sample is also smaller than that of the MnSe-7 and MnSe-8 samples. 

To investigate the effect of the time evolution, the hydrothermal time was varied from 12 h to 48 h with glycerol and 2 g of SDS. After 36 h reaction (MnSe-4), pure phase α-MnSe could be produced and no reflection peaks of MnSe2 could be observed. 

The synthesized α-MnSe crystals were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement performed on a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer using monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ= 1.54056 Å) with 2θ ranging from 10o to 80o (40 kV, 40 mA)(Japan). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken from a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscopy (Japan). The samples were also subjected to energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) during the SEM measurement.

Please note that while this process was used to synthesize α-MnSe crystals, it may not be directly applicable to the synthesis of 2500 nm MnSe nanoparticles.

The synthesis of CuS nanoparticles (NPs) was carried out using a simple and green method. The precursor complex used was Cu(II) complex of pyridine-2-carboxamide, which served as the copper source. This was synthesized in the presence of excess pyridine-2-carboxamide, which acted as a capping agent. Water was selected as the solvent for this process, and no commercial capping agent or additive was involved in this method.

The precursor complex [CuL2(H2O)2]Cl2 (where L is pyridine 2-carboxamide) was prepared in a stirred solution. To this solution, thiourea was added drop-wise. The pH of the solution was then adjusted to 8.0 by slowly adding dilute ammonia. Another batch of the ligand, pyridine 2-carboxamide, was added to the resulting solution. The solution was then refluxed for 4 hours. A greenish-black precipitate of CuS NPs was obtained.

The precipitate was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation, washed with methanol and water several times. The product was then dried in an air oven and kept for further characterization.

The crystallinity and phase purities of CuS NPs were first examined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The size and morphology of the product were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The average size of the CuS nanoparticles was estimated from the diffraction peak (110) by using the Debye-Scherrer equation (D¼0.9l/(bCosy)) as about 30 nm. However, the TEM image showed that the CuS NPs are composed of rectangular or quasi-rectangular nanoparticles with an average diameter of 40–50 nm.

The article does not provide specific information on how to synthesize CuS NPs of 45 nm size. However, the size of nanoparticles is often controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions such as temperature, reaction time, and the concentration of the reactants. Therefore, it might be possible to synthesize 45 nm CuS NPs by optimizing these parameters."

The synthesis of CuS nanoparticles (NPs) was carried out using a simple and green method. The precursor complex used was Cu(II) complex of pyridine-2-carboxamide, which served as the copper source. This was synthesized in the presence of excess pyridine-2-carboxamide, which acted as a capping agent. Water was selected as the solvent for this process, and no commercial capping agent or additive was involved in the method.

The precursor complex [CuL2(H2O)2]Cl2 (where L is pyridine 2-carboxamide) was prepared in a stirred solution. To this solution, thiourea was added drop-wise. The pH of the solution was then adjusted to 8.0 by slowly adding dilute ammonia. Following this, another batch of the ligand, pyridine 2-carboxamide, was added to the resulting solution. The solution was then refluxed for 4 hours. A greenish-black precipitate of CuS NPs was obtained.

The precipitate was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation, and then washed with methanol and water several times. The product was then dried in an air oven and kept for further characterization.

The crystallinity and phase purities of the CuS NPs were first examined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The size and morphology of the product were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The average size of the CuS nanoparticles was estimated from the diffraction peak (110) by using the Debye-Scherrer equation as about 30 nm. However, the TEM image showed that the CuS NPs are composed of rectangular or quasi-rectangular nanoparticles with an average diameter of 40–50 nm.

The article does not provide specific information on how to synthesize CuS NPs of a different size, such as 45 nm. The size of the nanoparticles can often be controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions, such as the concentration of the reactants, the reaction temperature, and the reaction time. However, specific details would require further research or experimentation."

The synthesis of CdS NPs (nanoparticles) is described in the article as a solvothermal decomposition process using the complex Cd(ACDA)2 as the precursor. The chemicals used for the preparation of the ligand 2-aminocyclopentene-1-dithiocarboxylic acid (HACDA) and the metal complex [Cd(ACDA)2] were of analytical grade. Ethylenediamine (EN), hexadecylamine (HDA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), tri-octylphosphine (TOP), Rose Bengal (RB), commercial CdS, terephthalic acid (TA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and 3,3,5,5-tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Standard titanium dioxide (Degussa-P25) was purchased from Degussa Company. Methanol, ethanol, acetic acid, diethyl ether and millipore water were used without any further purification.

The ligand (HACDA) was prepared according to the reported method. To a clear methanol solution (10 mL) of HACDA (160 mg, 1 mmol) was added dropwise with stirring to an aqueous solution (10 mL) of cadmium chloride (92 mg, 0.5 mmol). The yellow compound that precipitated was filtered after 15 min and washed first with methanol and then with diethyl ether.

CdS NPs were prepared by solvothermal decomposition of the single-source precursor using EN, HDA or DMSO as the solvents. In case of EN and DMSO, 250 mg of the precursor was dissolved in 20 mL solvent in a round bottom flask. For the preparation of CdS NPs using HDA, 250 mg of the precursor was dissolved in 5 mL hot TOP and then it was added to a 15 mL hot HDA solution in a round bottom flask. The resulting clear yellow solutions were heated at 120 ◦C for 15 min and then cooled to room temperature. At this stage, 20 mL methanol was added to them. Thus obtained yellow precipitates were centrifuged, followed by washing with ethanol for several times for their purification. The pure nanomaterials were collected after drying in oven at 50 ◦C for 30 min.

The reaction conditions and results are summarized in Table 1. The average size of the CdS NPs obtained from EN was 4.8 nm (rod-shaped), from HDA+TOP was 3.4 nm (spherical), and from DMSO was 5.6 nm (spherical). The CdS nanorods obtained from EN had a length of 70 nm. The article does not provide specific information on how to control the size of the nanoparticles beyond these results."

The synthesis of CdS nanoparticles (NPs) of varying sizes, including 70 nm, is described in the article. The process involves the solvothermal decomposition of a single-source precursor using different solvents. 

The precursor used for the synthesis is a Cd(II) complex of 2-aminocyclopentene-1-dithiocarboxylic acid (HACDA), denoted as [Cd(ACDA)2]. This complex is prepared by reacting a methanol solution of HACDA with an aqueous solution of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) in a 2:1 ratio. The precursor complex is insoluble in water and common organic solvents, but fairly soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylformamide. The composition of the precursor complex was established by elemental analyses, ESI-MS, and FTIR spectroscopic methods.

For the preparation of CdS NPs, 250 mg of the precursor is dissolved in 20 mL of solvent in a round bottom flask. The solvents used are ethylenediamine (EN), hexadecylamine (HDA), or DMSO. In the case of HDA, the precursor is first dissolved in 5 mL of hot tri-octylphosphine (TOP) before being added to a 15 mL hot HDA solution in a round bottom flask. The resulting clear yellow solutions are heated at 120 ◦C for 15 minutes and then cooled to room temperature. At this stage, 20 mL of methanol is added. The resulting yellow precipitates are centrifuged, followed by washing with ethanol several times for purification. The pure nanomaterials are collected after drying in an oven at 50 ◦C for 30 minutes.

The reaction conditions and results are summarized in Table 1 of the article. For instance, when EN is used as the solvent, the resulting CdS NPs are rod-shaped with an average size of 4.8 nm and a length of 70 nm. When HDA and TOP are used, the resulting NPs are spherical with an average size of 3.4 nm. When DMSO is used, the resulting NPs are also spherical but with an average size of 5.6 nm.

The synthesized CdS NPs are characterized using various techniques, including Perkin-Elmer 2400II analyzer for elemental analyses, JASCO FTIR-460-Plus spectrophotometer for FTIR spectra, Micromass Qtof YA 263 mass spectrometer for ESI-MS measurements, Philips PW 1140 parallel beam X-ray diffractometer for XRD patterns, JEOL JEM-2100 microscope for TEM images, Hitachi S-3400 N (EDS, Horiba EMAX) instrument for EDX analyses, and Quantachrome Instruments for N2-sorption isotherms. UV–vis absorption spectra are recorded with a JASCO V-530 UV–vis spectrophotometer, and photoluminescence measurements are carried out using a Photon Technology International fluorometer."

The synthesis of yolk-shell Au@HCNs (Au nanoparticles encapsulated by hollow carbon nanospheres) is described in the provided text. The process begins with the preparation of a wine-red solution of Au nanoparticles, which is achieved according to previous literature. Unfortunately, the exact mmols of the reagents used for this step are not specified in the provided text.

These Au nanoparticles are then capped with a SiO2 shell through the Stöber process, which involves the hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). This results in the formation of Au@SiO2 nanospheres. The next step involves impregnating the Au@SiO2 nanospheres with dopamine in Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5). The polymerization of dopamine molecules on the surface of Au@SiO2 then slowly yields Au@SiO2@polydopamine (PDA) nanocomposites.

Subsequently, the obtained Au@SiO2@PDA nanoparticles are carbonized in N2 at 800 °C for 2 hours. Finally, the silica core is etched with NaOH, resulting in the yolk-shell structure of Au particles encapsulated by hollow carbon nanospheres, abbreviated as Au@HCNs. It is emphasized in the text that the dopamine used in the experiments provides a nitrogen source, and the nitrogen atoms incorporated in the carbon shell are considered to be an effective method to regulate the properties of carbon.

The text also mentions the use of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) for imaging, dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis for determining particle size distributions, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements for confirming the successful encapsulation of Au in the hollow carbon spheres, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for measuring the content of Au in the Au@HCNs.

The average diameter of the Au@HCNs is about 180 nm, with the diameter of the Au nanoparticle being about ~ 10 nm and the carbon shell thickness being 6 ~ 7 nm. The hydrated particle sizes of AuNPs, HCNs and Au@HCNs were 23.24 ± 0.116 nm, 273 ± 0.316 nm and 275 ± 0.355 nm, respectively. The Au content in the yolk-shell structure was about 4.46% after calcination in O2."

For purposes of comparison, N-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (HCNs) were also synthesized as the control group.

The morphology evolution from Au nanoparticles to Au@HCNs is shown in Figure 1B and Figure S1. The Au@HCNs were uniformly distributed spheres with an average diameter about 180 nm, where almost every hollow carbon nanosphere contained an Au nanoparticle embedded near the inner carbon shell. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Figure S2) demonstrates that the diameter of Au nanoparticle was about ~ 10 nm and the carbon shell thickness was 6 ~ 7 nm.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 175 nm WC nanoparticles. However, it does describe the synthesis of WC nanorods (WC NRs) with an average diameter of 30–50 nm and length of 150–200 nm. 

The synthesis of WC NRs involves several steps. Sodium tungstate dihydrate (Na2WO4  2H2O) (0.6579 g) and ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) (0.5286 g) are dissolved in 15 mL deionized water. Then, a hydrochloric acid (HCl) aqueous solution (3 M) is added under stirring until the pH value reaches 2.0. The solution is maintained in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 180 1С for 8 hours. The precipitate is then filtered, washed several times with water and ethanol, and dried at 60 1С to obtain WO3 nanorods. 

The as-prepared WO3 nanorods and glucose (molar ratio W/C¼0.078) are dissolved in 15 mL deionized water and stirred for 20 minutes before hydrothermal treatment at 180 1С for 8 hours. Finally, the as-prepared precursors of carbon-coated WO3 nanorods are calcined at 900 1С under a flow of H2/Ar (VH2/VAr¼1:3, 300 mL min1) for 3 hours to form nanorod-structured WC materials.

The as-prepared WC NRs are then analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). 

It's important to note that this process results in WC nanorods, not nanoparticles. The size and shape of the resulting WC structures are likely influenced by the specific conditions and parameters of the synthesis process, such as the concentration of the starting materials, the temperature and duration of the hydrothermal treatment, and the conditions of the calcination step. Adjusting these parameters may result in WC structures of different sizes or shapes, but the article does not provide specific information on how to synthesize 175 nm WC nanoparticles."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 12 nm or other size Si nanoparticles (Si-dots). However, it does mention that the Si-dots were successfully synthesized by the phosphomolybdic acid (POM)-assisted electrochemical etching of bulk Si. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) image and the histogram of particle size distribution indicate that the Si-dots mostly appear as spherical dots with a high monodispersity, and with diameters of 4–25 nm. The average size was about 12 nm in diameter.

The article does not provide specific details on the equipment used, the reagents, or the mmols involved in the synthesis process.

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 12 nm or other size Si nanoparticles (NPs). However, it does mention that the Si-dots, which are essentially silicon nanoparticles, were synthesized by phosphomolybdic acid (POM)-assisted electrochemical etching of bulk Si. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) image and the histogram of particle size distribution indicate that the Si-dots mostly appear as spherical dots with a high monodispersity, and with diameters of 4–25 nm. The average size was about 12 nm in diameter.

The Si-dots were characterized using various techniques. The morphology and optical properties of the as-prepared Si-dots were characterized and the results are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Electric diffraction (ED) (Fig. S1B, ESI†) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Fig. S1C, ESI†) patterns of the Si-dots indicate that these nanoparticles exhibit single crystalline structures.

To confirm the presence of a hydrogen terminated surface (H–Si), optical properties of the Si-dots, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-vis and fluorescence spectra (FL) measurements were performed. The FTIR spectrum (Fig. S1D, ESI†) shows a strong stretching vibration of Si–H bonds at around 900 cm1 and the stretching vibration of coupled H–Si–Si–H bonds at 2100 cm1.

The UV-vis absorption (red) and photoluminescence (black) spectra of the Si-dots in aqueous solution are presented in Fig. S1E (ESI†). The absorbance at about 290 nm is due to the Si-dots. The emission spectrum of the Si-dots solution has a narrow band ranging from 400 to 500 nm, which further illustrates that the sizes of the Si-dots are uniform.

The article does not provide specific instructions for the synthesis of 10 nm CdS nanoparticles. However, it does discuss the synthesis of CdS nanoparticles of various sizes and shapes by one-step decomposition of a newly synthesized precursor complex. The precursor complex used is [Cd(SOCPh)2Lut2], which is unstable in the presence of nucleophiles and under thermal conditions. The decomposition of this precursor can lead to the formation of [CdS]2 crystal nuclei, which are highly active and have a tendency to combine with each other to grow into larger nanocrystals.

The reaction conditions, such as temperature and time, as well as the use of different solvents, can influence the size and shape of the resulting nanoparticles. For example, when NH3 is used as a solvent at 27 ◦C for 12 hours, the resulting CdS nanoparticles have a spherical shape with an average size of 3.86 nm and a specific surface area of 26.6 m2 g−1. When the precursor is directly annealed at 400 ◦C for 1 hour, it gives nanospheres of larger size, with an average size of 6.7 nm and a specific surface area of 57.3 m2 g−1.

The structure and optical properties of the CdS nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherm measurements. The XRD and TEM results showed that the average particle sizes are similar to those obtained from the reaction conditions. The BET measurements were used to determine the porous nature of the CdS nanoparticles, with the average pore diameters found to be in the range of 2.2–4.5 nm.

In conclusion, while the article does not provide specific instructions for the synthesis of 10 nm CdS nanoparticles, it does provide valuable information on the synthesis of CdS nanoparticles of various sizes and shapes.

The article does not provide specific instructions for the synthesis of 10 nm CdS nanoparticles. However, it does discuss the synthesis of CdS nanoparticles of various sizes and shapes by changing the reaction conditions. The precursor complex [Cd(SOCPh)2Lut2] was used for the synthesis, and its structure was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The CdS nanoparticles were obtained by one-step decomposition of this precursor complex.

Different types of CdS nanoparticles were obtained by changing the reaction conditions. For instance, when the precursor was annealed at 400 °C, it resulted in larger quasi-spherical nanoparticles. When solvents like NH3 were employed at 120 °C for 15 min and 27 °C for 12 h, the CdS nanoparticles showed spherical morphology with hexagonal crystallite. The average particle sizes as observed from the TEM images were similar to the results of XRD measurements for CdS nanoparticles obtained from EN, DMSO, and NH3.

The microstructure of the CdS nanoparticles was further analyzed using their SAED patterns and HRTEM images. The SAED patterns suggested the small and polycrystalline nature of the materials. The HRTEM images showed the structurally uniform lattice fringes of nanocrystals, suggesting the good crystalline nature of the prepared materials.

The porous nature of CdS nanoparticles was determined using BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) isotherm measurements under N2 atmosphere. The average pore diameters were calculated by the Bopp–Jancso–Heinzinger (BJH) method, which showed that the average pore diameters were in the range of 2.2–4.5 nm. The specific surface areas were also calculated and were found to be in the range of 26.6–57.3 m2 g−1.

In conclusion, while the article does not provide specific instructions for the synthesis of 10 nm CdS nanoparticles, it does provide a detailed description of the synthesis process and the factors that can influence the size and shape of the nanoparticles.

The article does not provide specific details on the exact quantities of reagents or the precise parameters for the synthesis of FeP nanoparticles (NPs). However, it does outline the general process and some of the techniques used.

The synthesis of FeP nanocubes was achieved through a facile route, which involved the synthesis of Prussian blue (PB) precursors and the subsequent phosphidation reaction. Prussian blue nanocubes were used as iron-based metal–organic frameworks precursors, and converted into FeP nanocubes through the thermal phosphidation reaction.

The as-prepared nanocomposites were initially characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to verify the crystal structures. The XRD patterns for PB and the phosphidated product were compared. The characteristic diffraction peaks of PB precursor are in agreement with Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3. In contrast to the sharp peaks of the original PB nanocubes, phosphidated product shows broadened and less-resolved peaks. The typical peaks of product can be identified clearly as orthorhombic FeP. No impurity is observed, which indicates that the product is pure FeP phase.

The morphology of FeP nanocubes was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The FeP nanocubes have a size of around 150 nm and possess a highly porous structure. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image further displays that the labeled spacing of 0.242 nm corresponds to the (111) plane distance of FeP crystal, consistent with the XRD result.

The samples before and after phosphidation were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM images of PB and FeP nanocubes show that the obtained FeP inherited the size and cubic morphology of PB precursor well, whereas their surfaces became very rough. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum clearly demonstrates that both Fe and P elements exist in FeP nanocubes, which is different from the EDS results of PB, indicating the formation of FeP.

To obtain detailed information about elemental composition and chemical state of samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out. The survey XPS spectrum of FeP reveals the presence of P and Fe elements. The peaks at 705.2 and 128.4 eV are close to the binding energy for Fe and P in FeP, which indicates the formation of FeP species.

The properties of nanomaterials are affected by the porous nature, morphology, and surface property. Thus, N2 adsorption/desorption measurement was conducted to characterize the porous property of FeP nanocubes. The BET surface area of the FeP nanocubes was calculated to be 39.55 m2 g1. The pore size of FeP nanocubes shows a relatively wide distribution. The average pore size distribution centers at around 12 nm, implying that the sample possesses the porous structure, which is in good agreement with the result of TEM."

The article does not provide specific details on the exact quantities of reagents or the precise parameters for the synthesis of FeP nanoparticles (NPs). However, it does outline the general process and some of the techniques used.

The synthesis of FeP nanocubes was achieved through a facile route, which involved the synthesis of Prussian blue (PB) precursors and the subsequent phosphidation reaction. Prussian blue nanocubes were used as iron-based metal–organic frameworks precursors, and converted into FeP nanocubes through the thermal phosphidation reaction.

The as-prepared nanocomposites were initially characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to verify the crystal structures. The XRD patterns for PB and the phosphidated product were compared. The characteristic diffraction peaks of PB precursor are in agreement with Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3. In contrast to the sharp peaks of the original PB nanocubes, phosphidated product shows broadened and less-resolved peaks. The typical peaks of product can be identified clearly as orthorhombic FeP.

The morphology of FeP nanocubes was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From the TEM images, it is noteworthy that the FeP nanocubes have a size of around 150 nm and possess a highly porous structure. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image further displays that the labeled spacing of 0.242 nm corresponds to the (111) plane distance of FeP crystal, consistent with the XRD result.

The samples before and after phosphidation were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM images of PB and FeP nanocubes are compared. It can be found that the obtained FeP inherited the size and cubic morphology of PB precursor well, whereas their surfaces became very rough. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum clearly demonstrates that both Fe and P elements exist in FeP nanocubes, which is different from the EDS results of PB, indicating the formation of FeP.

To obtain detailed information about elemental composition and chemical state of samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out. The survey XPS spectrum of FeP reveals the presence of P and Fe elements. High-resolution Fe 2p spectrum of PB shows two peaks at 707.4 and 719.9 eV, corresponding to the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 states. However, there are two peaks (705.2 and 710.1 eV) in the Fe 2p3/2 region for FeP. The peaks at 128.4 and 129.3 eV reflect the binding energy of P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2 of FeP, respectively. The peaks at 705.2 and 128.4 eV are close to the binding energy for Fe and P in FeP, which indicates the formation of FeP species.

Finally, N2 adsorption/desorption measurement was conducted to characterize the porous property of FeP nanocubes. The isotherm curves are identified as type III, which is characteristic of larger mesoporous and macroporous materials. The BET surface area of the FeP nanocubes was calculated to be 39.55 m2 g1. The pore size of FeP nanocubes shows a relatively wide distribution. The average pore size distribution centers at around 12 nm, implying that the sample possesses the porous structure, which is in good agreement with the result of TEM."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 20 nm or other size Au nanoparticles (AuNPs), including the equipment used, reagents, and mmols. However, it does mention that in this study, monodisperse AuNPs with 15-20 nm in diameter are eco-friendly fabricated using cyclodextrin (CD) molecules as both reducing agents and stabilizers. This approach is different from previous methods for the fabrication of macrocycle-AuNP hybrid nanomaterials, where harsh reagents and/or conditions were commonly used.

The article also discusses the unique properties of AuNPs and their potential applications. For instance, AuNPs possess distance dependent surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band, which has been extensively employed for designing assembly/disassembly modulated colorimetric sensors. They are also ideal energy acceptors in constructing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system for sensing and biosensing. Furthermore, AuNPs exhibit catalytic activity, which makes them potential candidates for the replacement of expensive Pt in some fields.

The specific properties/applications of AuNPs are dependent on several factors including particle size, shape, surface chemistry, aggregation state, and preparation method. For example, a relatively large size (> 10 nm) is essential for distinct SPR band, while catalytic activity is commonly believed to be the privilege of ultra-small AuNPs (~ 2 nm).

In terms of the hybrid materials, the article mentions that pre-existing researches mainly concentrate on their host-guest interaction based properties/functions/applications. Considering that macrocyclic supramolecules possess unique topological structures, their interactions with AuNPs might unusually modulate the particle surface chemistry and result in novel properties and corresponding potential applications."

These reagents are not only environmentally unfriendly, but their extremely high binding affinity and/or strong interactions might passivate/block the surface properties of AuNPs.

The article also mentions that the specific properties/applications of AuNPs depend on a series of factors including particle size, shape, surface chemistry, aggregation state, and preparation method. For example, a relatively large size (> 10 nm) is essential for distinct surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band, while catalytic activity is commonly believed to be the privilege of ultra-small AuNPs (~ 2 nm).

In this study, the researchers first demonstrate a three-in-one nano-platform for sensing, self-assembly, and cascade catalysis enabled by CD modified AuNPs (CD@AuNPs). The CD@AuNPs can act as building blocks and assemble into well-defined one- and two-dimensional (1D/2D) superstructures with the assistance of tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) as mediator."

The synthesis of β-CD protected Cu-NCs (Copper Nanoclusters) was carried out using a specific procedure. The reactants concentration including N2H4, NaOH, Cu (NO3)2, 6-SH-β-CD and reaction time, reaction temperature were investigated to obtain the optimal synthetic conditions. 

In a typical synthesis, 2 mL of 5 mM 6-SH-β-CD and 250 μL of 20 mM Cu(NO3)2 solution were first dissolved in 1 mL of Milli-Q water by stirring for 10 min at 45 °C. Then, 1.6 mL of 0.1 M NaOH was added and homogenized by stirring for 2 min. After that, 15 μL of N2H4 (50 wt%) was added, and the mixture was heated at 45 °C for 5 h. 

The Cu-NCs were then purified via dialysis to remove unreacted Cu2+. The formation of water-soluble and blue-emitting Cu-NCs was characterized using TEM, FTIR, fluorescence, absorption spectra and Raman spectra. The as-prepared β-CD protected Cu-NCs was diluted 50 times for TEM detection. The TEM image showed the β-CD protected Cu-NCs displayed an average diameter of 2 nm.

The optical properties of Cu-NCs were characterized by fluorescence and absorption spectra. The maximum fluorescence excitation and emission wavelength of β-CD-protected Cu-NCs were 360 nm and 450 nm. Compared to the absorption peak of β-CD at 220 nm, a new absorption peak at 270 nm was presented in the absorption curve of the β-CD protected Cu-NCs. 

The long time stability of β-CD protected Cu-NCs was also investigated. The fluorescence intensity of the Cu-NCs changed less than 5 % of its initial intensity after one month’s storage in the refrigerator which indicated its excellent aqueous stability. 

The UV–Vis absorption measurements were performed on a Lambda 35 UV analyzer. The fluorescence intensity was recorded on a LS55 fluorescence spectrometer. The TEM images of the prepared samples were examined using a TecnaiG20 transmission electron microscope.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 420 nm or other size boron nitride nanoparticles (BN NPs). The text mainly discusses the characterization, modification, and application of c-BN particles, but it does not detail the synthesis process or the parameters involved in creating these particles of a specific size. 

The characterization of c-BN is discussed in the article. The XRD pattern of the sample demonstrates the presence of c-BN. The corresponding scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows that c-BN particles are of irregular-particle shape. A statistical analysis of 250 particles according to SEM data reveals that the diameter of c-BN particles is mainly distributed in 100-800 nm with the average size of approximately 420 nm. Complementary analytical data on c-BN particles using energy-dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDX) confirm that only boron and nitrogen are present.

The modification of c-BN is also mentioned. C-BN was modified by ion implantation and thermal annealing, respectively. In an ion Implantation experiment, the sample was treated by ions at energy of 200 keV and doses of 1×1015 cm-2, using an ion implanter. The implanted ion species are helium, boron and nitrogen, respectively. In an annealing experiment, c-BN was subjected to heat treatment at 800°C for 2 hours. The annealing is done in a nitrogen atmosphere and air, respectively.

The article also discusses the peroxidase-like activity of c-BN particles. They are capable of catalyzing typical peroxidase reactions, using 3 typical peroxidase substrates, including 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB), o-Phenylenediamine (OPD) and 3,3,5,5-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of H2O2 to produce a brown, orange, and blue color reaction, respectively.

The synthesis of hierarchical BiOBr microspheres, which are composed of nanosheets, is described in the article. The process involves a solvothermal method. 

The materials required for the synthesis include Bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3$5H2O), 1-buty-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([Bmim]Br), and ethylene glycol (EG). These were purchased from Kelong Chemical Reagents Company (Chengdu, China). All chemicals used in this study were of commercially available analytical grade and used without further purification.

The preparation of the hierarchical BiOBr microspheres was carried out as follows: 1 mmol of Bi(NO3)3$5H2O was dissolved in 15 mL of ethylene glycol to form a clear solution by ultrasound, followed by the addition of 1 mmol of [Bmim]Br ionic liquid. The mixture was then transferred into a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave which was sealed and heated at 160 C for 12 hours. After the heat treatment, the autoclave was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature, and the products (IL–EG–BiOBr) were collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and deionized water thoroughly, and dried at 60 C in air. 

For comparison, BiOBr products were synthesized under the same conditions by replacing [Bmim]Br with KBr (EG–BiOBr) or EG solvent with water (IL–water–BiOBr). The BiOBr products were also synthesized by a similar hydrothermal method using both water as solvent and KBr as bromide source (water–BiOBr).

The synthesized BiOBr microspheres were characterized using various techniques. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were recorded on a Rigaku Dmax/Ultima IV diffractometer with monochromatized Cu Ka radiation (l ¼ 0.15418 nm). The morphology was observed with a JEOL JSM-6510LV scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G20). The elemental composition of the samples were characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford instruments X-Max). UV-vis diffused reflectance spectra of the samples were obtained for the dry-pressed film samples using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu, Japan). BaSO4 was used as a reflectance standard in a UV-vis diffuse reflectance experiment.

The article does not specify the size of the synthesized BiOBr nanoparticles, but it mentions that the BiOBr product was composed of nanosheets assembled cotton-like solid spheres with diameters of about 1–2 mm.

The synthesis of BiOI nanostructures, including those with a size of approximately 20 nm, is described in the article. The BiOI nanostructures were synthesized from Bi3+ ions and iodide ions (I-) in aqueous solution through the reaction Bi3+ + I- + H2O - BiOI(s) + 2H+ at room temperature. 

For the preparation of BiOI nanostructures, 50 mM Tris–borate (pH 7.0, 1 mL), Bi(NO3)2 (10 mM, 50 mL), and potassium iodide (10 mM, 50 mL) were sequentially added to DI water (3.9 mL) under continuous stirring, and subsequently reacted at ambient temperature for 2 h in the dark. 

The BiOI nanostructures were characterized using various techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the BiOI nanonetworks were obtained using a Tecnai 20 G2 S-twin transmission electron microscope. Samples for X-ray diffraction (XRD) were prepared by depositing the BiOI nanostructure solution on glass slides. XRD measurements were carried out at room temperature using a Rigaku 18 kW rotating anode source X-ray diffractometer (operated at 50 kV and 100 mA) with a Cu Ka1 line (l = 1.54 Å). Samples for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were prepared by depositing the BiOI nanostructure solution on a Si(100) wafer prior to measurement with a field emission SEM (JSM-6500F, JEOL, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). 

The TEM, AFM, and SEM images reveal that BiOI has a nanonetwork-like structure that is formed through the connection of high-density small nanoplates (B20 nm) with thickness around B5 nm. The slow growth rate of BiOI and the hydrolysis of iodide result in the formation of BiOI having a nanonetwork structure. The yields of these nanostructures were all almost the same (B60%). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal that the BiOI nanostructures have typical tetragonal crystal structures and are predominantly exposed along the {001} facet. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of BiOI nanostructures, including those with a size of approximately 20 nm, involves the reaction of Bi3+ ions and iodide ions in an aqueous solution at room temperature, with the use of specific reagents and under specific conditions. The resulting nanostructures are characterized by various techniques to confirm their size, structure, and other properties."

For determination of the concentrations of metal ions using ICP-MS, the BiOI nanostructure samples were prepared in 2% HNO3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a VG ESCA Scientific theta probe spectrometer.

The TEM, AFM, and SEM images reveal that BiOI has a nanonetwork-like structure that is formed through the connection of high-density small nanoplates (approximately 20 nm) with a thickness around 5 nm. The slow growth rate of BiOI and the hydrolysis of iodide result in the formation of BiOI having a nanonetwork structure. The yields of these nanostructures were almost the same (approximately 60%). The XRD patterns reveal that the BiOI nanostructures have typical tetragonal crystal structures and are predominantly exposed along the {001} facet. Quantitative analysis using XPS, ICP-OES or ICP-MS reveals that the ratios of Bi to I in the BiOI nanostructures are higher than 1. This finding is consistent with the results of XRD, which shows that Bi2O3 is present in the BiOI nanostructures."

The synthesis of BiOI nanoparticles (NPs) is described in the article through a facile coprecipitation method. The process involves the use of several reagents and specific conditions. 

In a typical procedure, 10.0 mmol of Bi(NO3)3⋅5H2O was added into 40 mL ethylene glycol (EG) under magnetic stirring to form a transparent solution. Meanwhile, 10.0 mmol of KI was dissolved in 40 mL water under magnetic stirring to obtain a transparent solution. Then the KI solution was added dropwise into the Bi(NO3)3 solutions slowly under vigorous stirring to form a final suspension. Afterwards, the pH value of the suspension was adjusted to 7.0 by 2.0 M NaOH. Then the suspension was sequentially stirred for 24 h. Finally, the precipitates were collected and washed several times by water and absolute ethyl alcohol (EA), followed by drying at 60 °C in air for 6 h. The final products BiOI nanoflowers were obtained, which were denoted as BiOI-F.

In addition, other BiOI samples were prepared as control. By using EA as the solvent instead of EG, BiOI microspheres were synthesized in a similar way with BiOI-F, which were denoted as BiOI-S. BiOI large plates were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. Typically, 10.0 mmol of Bi(NO3)3⋅5H2O was dispersed in 40 mL water mixed with 20 mL NaOH aqueous solution (0.75 M) with ultrasonic for 30 min to form a uniform suspension. Then 20 mL KI aqueous solution (30.0 mmol) was added to the above suspension under stirring. The suspension was stirred for another 60 min and then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was sealed, maintained at 180 °C for 24 h, and cooled to room temperature naturally. The precipitates were collected by filtration, washed with water and absolute ethyl alcohol several times, respectively, dried at 60 °C in air for 6 h. And BiOI large plates were obtained and denoted as BiOI-LP.

As increasing the NaOH amount to 1.0 M and 1.5 M during the reaction, BiOI nanoplates and Bi5O7I nanobelts could be obtained, which were denoted as BiOI-NP and Bi5O7I-B, respectively. 

The article does not specify the exact size of the nanoparticles synthesized, but the FESEM images reveal that the hierarchical flower-like nanostructures were self-assembled by many nanoplates with a thickness of 10 nm and a width of 100 nm."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 2500 nm Co4N nanoparticles. However, it does detail the preparation of Co4N nanowires (NWs), which might be similar in some aspects. 

The materials and reagents used in the synthesis of Co4N NWs include Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4·2H2O, H2O2 (30%), ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Co(NO3)2·6H2O, NH4F, and urea. These were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Terephthalic acid (TA) was purchased from Aladdin Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). 3,3′,5,5′-Teramethylbenzidine (TMB), glucose, and glucose oxidase (GOx) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). All solutions were prepared using deionized (DI) water (>18 MΩ).

The apparatus used in the synthesis includes field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Hitachi S-4800, Tokyo, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL 2000) for observing the morphologies of Co4N and the precursor. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X’pert XRD spectrometer (Philips, Guildford, Surrey, UK) with a Cu Kα X-ray source. UV–Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Lambda Bio/XLS+ UV–vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, USA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) profiles were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Physical Electronics 5600 spectrometer using Al Ka radiation at 13 kV as the excitation source.

The Co4N NWs were prepared by nitridation using Co(OH)(CO3)0.5·xH2O as the precursor. Briefly, Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.291 g), NH4F (0.093 g), and urea (0.30 g) were dissolved in 35 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring for 30 min. The solution was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, and the temperature was maintained at 120°C for 6 h. The obtained precursor Co(OH)(CO3)0.5·xH2O was washed three times with DI water and dried in vacuum at 60°C. Nitridation was carried out by treating Co(OH)(CO3)0.5·xH2O at 500 °C for 2 h in a tube furnace under flowing NH3, affording 50 mg Co4N powder in the crucible.

The peroxidase-like activity of Co4N NWs was investigated by the catalytic oxidation of the peroxidase substrate TMB in the presence of H2O2. In a typical experiment, catalytic oxidation was carried out at 25 °C by mixing 15 µL of Co4N (2.0 mg mL−1) with 2.0 mL of phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 20 mM, pH 4.0) in a quartz cuvette, followed by the addition of 80 µL of TMB (20 mM) and 30 µL of H2O2 (2.0 M). The mixture was stirred with an extremely small magnetic bar for 10 min, affording a blue color solution. After stirring was completed, Co4N NWs settled to the bottom of the cuvette, and the upper clear blue solution was used for absorption measurement. The blue color was spectrophotometrically monitored by measuring the absorbance change at 652 nm. All catalytic experiments were carried out under daylight, unless otherwise stated.

The synthesis of CoOOH nanoflakes, which are essentially nanoparticles (NPs) with an average flake size of about 100 nm, is described in the article. The procedure is based on a previous report with some modifications.

The reagents used for the synthesis include Cobaltous chloride (CoCl2·6H2O) and sodium hypochlorite pentahydrate (NaClO·5H2O) which were bought from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI) Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Ultrapure water was produced by the Millipore Milli-Q water purification system (Billerica, MA, USA) and had an electric resistance of >18.25 MΩ.

The synthesis process is as follows: 125 μL of 1.0 M NaOH solution were added to 500 μL of 10 mM CoCl2 solution with stirring. After sonicating for 10 min, 25 μL 0.9 M sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) solution were added to the mixture and sonication was performed for another 30 min. Subsequently, the CoOOH nanoflakes were isolated by centrifugation, washed several times with ultrapure water, and re-dispersed into ultrapure water for further experiments.

The characterization of the synthesized CoOOH nanoflakes was carried out using various equipment.

The synthesis of Cu2-xSe@PSS NCs, where the size of the nanoparticles (NPs) ranged from 26 nm to 53 nm with an average size of 40 nm, was described in the article. The process involved several steps and the use of various reagents and equipment.

Firstly, all of the glassware used in the procedure was immersed in aqua regia for 8 hours and cleared with water prior to use. The Cu2-xSe@PSS NPs were prepared with a minor modification. Initially, 1.6 mL of 10 mg/mL PSS (Sodium polystyrene sulfonate, MW 70kD) purchased from Alfa Aesar Company in America and 5.5 mL of water were added into the round bottom flask. Then, 0.1 mL of 0.1 M SeO2 obtained from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and 0.3 mL of 0.4 M Vc (Ascorbic acid) purchased from Sigma Company in America were injected within 10 minutes under vigorous agitation.

Following this, the mixed solution of 0.1 mL of 0.4 M CuSO4•5H2O (Copper sulfate) acquired from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) and 0.4 mL of 0.4 M Vc was added into the above solution. The reaction was considered complete when the solution turned green after about 10 hours at 30 °C. Finally, the mixed solution was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 minutes and dialyzed for 24 hours.

The nanostructure and morphology of the Cu2-xSe@PSS NPs were characterized using various apparatus. The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a U-3600 spectrophotometer (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Scanning electron microscopy images and transmission electron microscopy images were captured using an S-4800 scan electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi, Japan) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEM-2100, Japan), respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed with a Shimadzu XRD-7000. Elemental analysis was performed on an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (Tyoto, Japan).

The article does not provide specific details on how to control the size of the nanoparticles to exactly 40 nm. However, it is generally understood in nanoparticle synthesis that factors such as the concentration of the reagents, the temperature, and the duration of the reaction can influence the size of the nanoparticles."

The synthesis of Cu2-xSe@PSS NCs, which includes nanoparticles of size ranging from 26 nm to 53 nm with an average size of 40 nm, is described in the article. The process involves several steps and uses various reagents and equipment.

Firstly, all of the glassware used in the procedure was immersed in aqua regia for 8 hours and cleared with water prior to use. The Cu2-xSe@PSS NPs were prepared with a minor modification. Initially, 1.6 mL of 10 mg/mL PSS (Sodium polystyrene sulfonate, MW 70kD) purchased from Alfa Aesar Company in America and 5.5 mL of water were added into the round bottom flask. Then, 0.1 mL of 0.1 M SeO2 obtained from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and 0.3 mL of 0.4 M Vc (Ascorbic acid) purchased from Sigma Company in America were injected within 10 minutes under vigorous agitation.

Following this, the mixed solution of 0.1 mL of 0.4 M CuSO4•5H2O (Copper sulfate) acquired from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) and 0.4 mL of 0.4 M Vc was added into the above solution. The reaction was considered complete when the solution turned green after about 10 hours at 30 °C. Finally, the mixed solution was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 minutes and dialyzed for 24 hours.

The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a U-3600 spectrophotometer (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Scanning electron microscopy images and transmission electron microscopy images were captured using an S-4800 scan electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi, Japan) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEM-2100, Japan), respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed with a Shimadzu XRD-7000. Elemental analysis was performed on an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (Tyoto, Japan).

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 8000 nm or other size Fe3(PO4)2 nanoparticles (NPs). However, it does detail the synthesis of Ferrous (II) phosphate nanoflowers (Fe3(PO4)2·8H2O NFs) which might be similar in process. 

The Fe3(PO4)2·8H2O NFs were synthesized by a facile coprecipitation technology. Three feeds were prepared for the synthesis. Feed 1 was the aqueous solution of 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP); Feed 2 was the aqueous solution of 0.188 mM ferrous sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O); Feed 3 was the aqueous solution of 0.125 mM sodium phosphate tribasic (Na3PO4). 

The process began with the addition of 10 mL of Feed 2 to 40 mL of Feed 1. After stirring for 20 minutes, another 10 mL of Feed 3 was added to the mixture of Feed 1 and Feed 2. The mixture was then incubated for 2 days under ambient conditions. The navy blue solid product obtained by centrifugation was washed several times with water and ethanol, respectively, and finally dried at 40 ℃ under vacuum. The water used for the whole preparation process was purged with N2. All the above operations were conducted under the N2 atmosphere to avoid Fe2+ being oxidized by the air.

The phase characterization of the as-prepared product was performed by Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D8 advanced diffractometer by Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5418 Å). The morphological investigations were carried out with field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Su8100, Hitachi, Japan). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was recorded using an attached Oxford Link ISIS energy-dispersive spectrometer.

In the synthesis process, 5 mmol of Iron (II) chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl₂·4H₂O) and 10 mmol sodium hypophosphite (NaH₂PO₂·H₂O) were dissolved in 33 ml mixed solution (Vglycol : VH₂O=1:1), followed by a vigorous stirring to obtain a homogeneous solution.

The synthesis of Fe₃(PO₄)₂(OH)₂ was carried out in a stainless steel (50 ml) Teflon-lined vessel under autogenous pressure. In a typical process, 5 mmol of FeCl₂·4H2O and 10 mmol NaH₂PO₄·H₂O were dissolved in 33 ml mixed solution (Vglycol : VH₂O=1:1), followed by a vigorously stirring to obtain a homogeneous solution, into which 2 mL ammonia was added slowly.

The size and morphology of the resulted product was observed by the FE-SEM. It is seen that the obtained Fe₃(PO₄)₂(OH)₂ are monodispersed crystals in a shape of octahedron with diameter in ca. 3–8 μm. The elemental mapping analyses are provided in Fig. 1. The elemental mapping analysis pictures are shown in Fig. C-F confirm the coexistence and homogenous dispersion of Fe, P, and O elements within Fe₃(PO₄)₂(OH)₂.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 125 nm FeS nanoparticles. However, it does detail the process used to synthesize FeS and FeSe nanoparticles of unspecified size. 

The synthesis of FeS and FeSe nanoparticles was achieved through the solvothermal decomposition of a precursor complex [Fe3(μ3-O)(μ2-O2CCH2Cl)6(H2O)3]NO3·H2O in the presence of thiourea and sodium selenite, respectively. The reaction between the aqueous solution of precursor complex and thiourea or sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) in 1:3 molar ratio was conducted at 150 °C under pressure for 12 hours, leading to the formation of FeS or FeSe as black powder. 

The precursor complex used, a water-soluble trinuclear oxo-bridged [Fe3(μ3-O)(μ2-O2CCH2Cl)6(H2O)3]+ core, was found to be an excellent precursor for the synthesis of iron chalcogenides. The concentrations of iron and sulfide/selenide ions were carefully controlled during the deposition of nanoparticles. This was facilitated by the slow release of iron ion from the water-soluble trinuclear iron core, which controlled its concentration. 

The pH of the precursor complex's aqueous solution, which lies between 2.5 and 3.0, was also found to be suitable for the deposition of iron chalcogenides. The existence of any anion of a strong acid often made it difficult to form metal chalcogenides, so the water-soluble iron core with chloroacetate anion, as a substitute of common iron salts, was a better precursor in many ways.

The as-obtained products were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV−vis spectroscopic techniques. Structural analyses revealed that the FeS and FeSe nanoparticles are composed of needle-like and spherical particles, respectively.

The synthesis of FeSe nanoparticles (NPs) of approximately 6 nm in size was achieved through the solvothermal decomposition of a precursor complex. The precursor complex used was [Fe3(μ3-O)(μ2-O2CCH2Cl)6(H2O)3]NO3·H2O. This was reacted with sodium selenite in a 1:3 molar ratio at 150 °C under pressure for 12 hours. This process resulted in the formation of FeSe as a black powder. The reaction between the aqueous solution of the precursor complex and sodium selenite leads to the reduction of iron(III) to iron(II) and the concomitant formation of FeSe. 

The concentrations of iron and selenide ions have to be controlled very carefully during the deposition of nanoparticles. This can be easily achieved using a complex with high stability and a moderately stable selenium source. In this case, a water-soluble trinuclear oxo-bridged [Fe3(μ3-O)(μ2-O2CCH2Cl)6(H2O)3]+ core was employed as a precursor complex, and sodium selenite was used as the selenium source. 

In the reaction system, the water-soluble trinuclear iron core facilitated the slow release of iron ion and thus controlled its concentration. The existence of any anion of a strong acid often made it difficult to form metal chalcogenides, so the water-soluble iron core with chloroacetate anion, as a substitute of common iron salts, is a better precursor in many ways. Another important advantage of this precursor complex is the pH of its aqueous solution that lies in between 2.5 and 3.0, which is also suitable for the deposition of iron chalcogenides.

The crystallinity and purity of the FeSe NPs were examined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The diffraction patterns of the powder materials can be indexed into pure FeSe phase crystallizing in the P4/nmm space group. The observed peaks are in good agreement with those reported for pure tetragonal phase of FeSe (JCPDS card no. 850735).

The synthesis of β-MnOOH nanoparticles (NPs) is described in the article. In a typical synthesis of β-MnOOH, 4 mmol of Mn(CH3COO)24H2O and 2 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were dissolved into a 60 mL of glycerol/H2O mixed solution (glycerol:H2O = 1:5 (v/v)) at room temperature to form a mixed solution under vigorous stirring. The mixture was stirred in air for about 10 min before 10 mL of N2H4H2O and 10 mL of 8 M sodium hydroxide were added. After being continuously stirred for 10 min, the reaction mixture was transferred into a 100 mL of Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed, and heated at 140 °C for 24 h. 

After the reaction was complete, the resulting solid product was collected by filtration, washed with water and absolute ethanol, and then dried at 60 °C for 24 h in air. The samples synthesized with different starting raw materials (without SDS and glycerol, without glycerol, without SDS, with SDS and glycerol, and without hydrazine) at 140 °C for 24 h were denoted as M140-1, M140-2, M140-3, M140-4, and M140-5, respectively. In the presence of hydrazine, SDS, and glycerol, the samples were also prepared at different temperatures (120, 160, and 180 °C) for 24 h and denoted as M120, M160, and M180, respectively.

The characterization of the synthesized NPs was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement on an Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) using monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 A) with 2 ˚ θ ranging from 10° to 80° (40 kV, 40 mA). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken from a Hitachi S-4800 SEM (Japan). Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) observations were performed under a Hitachi 7650 transmission electron microscopy (Japan). The samples were also subjected to energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) during the SEM measurement.

The article does not specify the exact size of the synthesized NPs, but it mentions that the average lateral size of the irregular hexagonal nanoplates was found to be about 200 nm and the particle size distribution is uniform. The estimated D002 of the as-prepared β-MnOOH has a value of ca. 17 nm."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 100 nm MoSe2 nanoparticles. However, it does describe the preparation of few-layered MoSe2 nanosheets from commercial MoSe2 powders. 

In the experimental section, it is mentioned that MoSe2 powders were purchased from Alfa Aesar. These powders were used to prepare few-layered MoSe2 nanosheets via a simple liquid exfoliation method. Briefly, commercial MoSe2 powders (2 g) were dissolved in a 45 vol % ethanol/water mixture (200 mL) and ultrasonicated for 8 hours at 80% amplitude at 10℃. The solution was then centrifuged two times at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatant was obtained by decantation. The suction filtration was carried out to remove ethanol and the filtered residue was redispersed into DI water by bath sonication for 10 minutes. Followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 minutes, the supernatant was collected as the few-layered MoSe2 nanosheets solution for further characterizations.

Materials characterization was performed using a Rigaku D/Max-IIIA X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation for X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of the samples were obtained using a UV 3150 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were acquired using an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 transition electron microscope equipped with a field-emission gun. The Raman spectra were collected by a Renishaw In Via spectrometer using a 514 nm laser for excitation. The thickness profile was acquired on a Bruker Multimode 8 atomic force microscope (AFM). Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed on Hitachi F-4500 Fluorescence spectrophotometer.

The article does not provide specific details on the size of the MoSe2 nanosheets produced, nor does it provide a method for controlling the size of the nanosheets. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a method for the synthesis of 100 nm MoSe2 nanoparticles based on the information given in the article."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 100 nm MoSe2 nanoparticles. However, it does describe the preparation of few-layered MoSe2 nanosheets from commercial MoSe2 powders. 

The materials used for this preparation include MoSe2 powders purchased from Alfa Aesar, anhydrous ethanol, and Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm) used for all solution preparations. The MoSe2 powders (2 g) were dissolved in a 45 vol % ethanol/water mixture (200 mL) and ultrasonicated for 8 hours at 80% amplitude at 10℃. The solution was then centrifuged two times at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatant was obtained by decantation. The suction filtration was carried out to remove ethanol and the filtered residue was redispersed into DI water by bath sonication for 10 minutes. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 minutes, the supernatant was collected as the few-layered MoSe2 nanosheets solution for further characterizations.

The characterization of the materials was performed using a Rigaku D/Max-IIIA X-ray diffractometer for X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.54056 Å, 40 kV, 20 mA) at a scanning rate of 2°/s. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of the samples were obtained using a UV 3150 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were acquired using an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 transition electron microscope equipped with a field-emission gun. The Raman spectra were collected by a Renishaw In Via spectrometer using a 514 nm laser for excitation. The thickness profile was acquired on a Bruker Multimode 8 atomic force microscope (AFM). Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed on Hitachi F-4500 Fluorescence spectrophotometer.

The article describes the synthesis of stable copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) using humic acid as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The nanoparticles were prepared by a facile annealing process. The products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

The Cu NPs were adhered on the surface of or well wrapped by humic acid, which was confirmed by the TEM image. Stable Cu NPs were successfully prepared, and the high stability property of Cu NPs may be mainly due to the stabilizing and reducing properties of humic acid. 

Cu NPs obtained at different raw mass ratios of copper acetate and humic acid were characterized by FESEM. As the ratio increased, the distribution density of Cu nanoparticles changed little, indicating that Cu2+ ions can be well distributed in humic acid to form uniformly distributed Cu NPs. However, the size of Cu nanoparticles gradually increased. While the ratio is up to 2.5:2.5, the size of Cu nanoparticles almost kept the same.

The FTIR spectra of three products were employed to confirm the changes of humic acid during the synthesis of Cu NPs. The absorption band at 3450 cm-1 is ascribed to the stretching of O-H and N-H, the peak at 1350 cm-1 is due to the stretching vibration of C-O, the peaks at 1460 cm-1 and 1650 cm-1 are assigned to the vibration of C-H and C-C respectively, and the 2300 cm-1 absorption peak represents the stretching of C≡N. 

In the calcinated humic acid, the intensity of peaks at 3450 cm-1 and 1500 cm-1 become weakened, but at 2300 cm-1, little enhancement could be observed, which indicates that C-H and O-H in the humic acid changed little. A new peak appearing at 2300 cm-1 confirms that C≡N bond was formed after the humic acid was calcinated in N2 atmosphere. 

In the final product, humic acid is only transformed to partially polymerized humic acid at 600 ºC. The Raman spectra demonstrate that two obvious bands at 1330 cm￾1 and 1600 cm-1 are attributed to the carbon material. The Raman shift at 2800 cm-1 comes from the humic acid according to the Raman spectra of humic acid. The Raman and TGA spectra further confirm that humic acid is not completely converted to carbon material.

In conclusion, the synthesis of Cu NPs involves the use of humic acid as a reducing and stabilizing agent, copper acetate, and an annealing process. The raw mass ratios of copper acetate and humic acid, as well as the calcination of humic acid in N2 atmosphere, play crucial roles in the formation and size of the Cu NPs."

The synthesis of stable copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) was achieved through a facile annealing process using humic acid as both the reducing and stabilizing agent. The nanoparticles were prepared by annealing a mixture of copper acetate and humic acid at 600 ºC for 2 hours. The raw mass ratios of copper acetate and humic acid were varied to investigate their influence on the catalytic activity of the products. The ratios ranged from 1.0:2.5, 2.5:2.5, 5.0:2.5 to 7.5:2.5. 

The prepared Cu NPs were characterized using various techniques. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm the formation of Cu NPs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the morphology of the Cu NPs. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was employed to confirm the changes of humic acid during the synthesis of Cu NPs. 

The FTIR spectra of three products were employed to confirm the changes of humic acid during the synthesis of Cu NPs. The absorption band at 3450 cm-1 is ascribed to the stretching of O-H and N-H, the peak at 1350 cm-1 is due to the stretching vibration of C-O, the peaks at 1460 cm-1 and 1650 cm-1 are assigned to the vibration of C-H and C-C respectively, and the 2300 cm-1 absorption peak represents the stretching of C≡N. 

The stability of the Cu NPs was further tested by measuring the XRD and SEM images of the Cu NPs before and after participating in the catalytic reaction. The XRD pattern of Cu NPs after the catalytic reaction was matched well with that of the freshly prepared Cu NPs and that of Cu NPs after exposing to air for 6 months, indicating the stability of Cu NPs during the catalytic reaction process. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of stable Cu NPs was achieved using humic acid as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The prepared Cu NPs showed remarkable intrinsic peroxidase-like activity and excellent stability, making them suitable for various applications such as the detection of glucose in human body and pear juice."

The synthesis of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) of around 3 nm in size is described in the provided text. The process involves the use of glutathione-capped Pd nanoparticles, which are synthesized with varying sizes from 1.4 to 3.5 nm. The molar ratio of [Na2PdCl4]/[GSH] greatly affects the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles, including their sizes, surface charge states, and enzymatic activities.

The synthesis of GSH-capped Pd nanoparticles is carried out using Na2PdCl4 as the precursor, and DMAB as the reducing agent. The physicochemical properties of GSH-Pd are investigated by varying the molar ratio of [Na2PdCl4]/[GSH] in the synthesis process. GSH-Pd prepared at the [Na2PdCl4]/[GSH] ratio of 3 exhibits an average diameter of 1.4 nm. The particle size gradually increases up to 3.5 nm as the [Na2PdCl4]/[GSH] ratio increases from 3 to 60. Therefore, GSH-Pd prepared at different molar ratios of [Na2PdCl4]/[GSH] are denoted as GSH-Pd1.4 ([Na2PdCl4]/[GSH]=3), GSH-Pd2.6 ([Na2PdCl4]/[GSH]=6) and GSH-Pd3.5 ([Na2PdCl4]/[GSH]=60), respectively.

In terms of characterization, UV-vis spectroscopy was performed on a Varian Cary300 spectrophotometer using a quartz glass cuvette with 1 cm path length. Transmission Electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on a JEM-2010FEF equipment (JEOL, Japan). All the average sizes were obtained by measuring more than 100 dispersive nanoparticles. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on the PHI5000 Versaprobe. In the sample preparation, 30 µL of as-prepared GSH-Pd solution was dropped onto a clean silicon wafer, and then dried under nitrogen gas atmosphere. This process was repeated thrice.

The deconvolution spectra of Pd 3d orbitals display two typical bands: the band at the binding energy of 336.9 eV corresponding to Pd2+ species and that at 334.9 eV corresponding to metallic Pd0. It is demonstrated that GSH-Pd1.4 contains 70% Pd2+ and 30% Pd0 species, respectively. With the particle size increasing from 1.4 to 3.5 nm, the proportion of Pd0 species increases significantly from 30% to 72%, whereas the fraction of Pd2+ species decreases from 70% to 28%.

In conclusion, the synthesis of Pd NPs of around 3 nm in size involves the use of Na2PdCl4 as the precursor, DMAB as the reducing agent, and GSH as the capping agent. The molar ratio of [Na2PdCl4]/[GSH] is adjusted to control the size of the nanoparticles. The synthesized nanoparticles are then characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy, TEM, and XPS."

With the particle size increasing from 1.4 to 3.5 nm, the proportion of Pd0 species increases significantly from 30% to 72%, whereas the fraction of Pd2+ species decreases from 70% to 28%.

Characterizations of the synthesized nanoparticles are performed using various techniques. UV-vis spectroscopy is performed on a Varian Cary300 spectrophotometer using a quartz glass cuvette with 1 cm path length. Transmission Electron microscopy (TEM) is carried out on a JEM-2010FEF equipment (JEOL, Japan). X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is performed on the PHI5000 Versaprobe.

The synthesis of Pt nanoparticles in this study was achieved through the reduction of K2PtCl4 by DMAB or NaBH4 in the presence of BSA. Firstly, 10 μM BSA dissolved in 10 mM PBS buffer (pH 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, respectively) were firstly incubated with K2PtCl4 at the [K2PtCl4]/[BSA] ratio of 30. After incubation for 2 h at 25 °C, freshly prepared DMAB or NaBH4 aqueous solution was added to the mixture at the [reductant]/[precursor] ratio 5, to start the reduction reaction at 25 °C. The obtained BSA–Pt can be used as the nanozyme after 5 h reaction.

The chemicals used in this process, including BSA (purity497%), dimethylamine borane (DMAB) and NaCl were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. K2PtCl4, CuCl2  2H2O, Pb(CH3COO)2  3H2O, Hg(ClO4)2  3H2O, Na2PdCl4 and HAuCl4  3H2O were purchased from Alfa Aesar. H2O2 (30 wt%) was purchased from J&K Scientific, and TMB was purchased from Heowns. Other reagents such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4), CoCl2  6H2O, MnCl2  4H2O, CdCl2  5/2H2O, ZnCl2, MgCl2  6H2O, CaCl2, FeCl3  6H2O, Ni(NO3)2  6H2O, Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4, were purchased from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Company. All the chemical reagents except BSA were of the purity higher than 99.9%, and used without further treatment. The water used in all experiments was distilled for three times.

The size distribution and the peroxidase-like activity of Pt nanoparticles are greatly associated with the reducing agent and the pH value used in the synthesis process. Importantly, Hg2þ is able to down-regulate the enzymatic activity of Pt nanoparticles. It is the first report to explore a colorimetric Hg2þ sensing system on the basis of peroxidase mimicking activities of Pt nanoparticles. BSA-stabilized Pt nanozymes demonstrate the ability to sense Hg2þ ions in aqueous solution without significant interference from other metal ions."

The synthesis of Pt nanoparticles in this study was achieved through the reduction of K2PtCl4 by DMAB or NaBH4 in the presence of BSA. The BSA was chosen as the nucleation template to synthesize the Pt nanoparticles using K2PtCl4 as the precursor. The BSA was dissolved in 10 mM PBS buffer (pH 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, respectively) and was firstly incubated with K2PtCl4 at the [K2PtCl4]/[BSA] ratio of 30. After incubation for 2 h at 25 °C, freshly prepared DMAB or NaBH4 aqueous solution was added to the mixture at the [reductant]/[precursor] ratio 5, to start the reduction reaction at 25 °C. The obtained BSA–Pt can be used as the nanozyme after 5 h reaction.

The characterizations of the synthesized Pt nanoparticles were done using CD, UV–vis, TEM and XPS. It was demonstrated that the size distribution and the peroxidase-like activity of Pt nanoparticles are greatly associated with the reducing agent and the pH value used in the synthesis process. The average diameter of the synthesized Pt nanoparticles was found to be 2.0 nm.

The synthesis of 80 nm chitosan-modified popcorn-like Au–Ag nanoparticles (CSPNPs) can be conveniently achieved by ascorbic acid reduction of hydrogen tetrachloroaurate in the presence of chitosan and silver nitrate. The process is carried out at room temperature without the need for seeds and surfactants. 

To prepare 80 nm CSPNPs, 150 μL of 29 mM HAuCl4 solution is added to 20 mL ultrapure water, and then 100 μL 10 mg/mL of chitosan (dissolved in 5% acetic acid) is added under stirring. One minute later, 60 μL of 6 mM silver nitrate is injected into the solutions, and 80 μL of 0.1 M ascorbic acid is added immediately. After the introduction of ascorbic acid, a colorless stage would maintain for about 5 s, followed by the emergence of blue color within 1 min indicating the formation of CSPNPs. No obvious color changes could be observed after 1 min. The mixture is kept stirring for 3 h. 

The final products are purified using centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 15 min, and then washing and redispersing in ultrapure water. This process is repeated three times. The size of CSPNPs with a high monodispersity can be adjusted by changing the amount of regents. 

The composition of 80 nm CSPNPs with the original Ag/Au mole ratio of 0.08:1 was investigated by ICP-AES, EDX. To conduct ICP-AES detection, CSPNPs were isolated by centrifugation at 3500 rpm in 15 min, washed three times and subsequently dissolved in aqua regia. ICP-AES data shows an Ag/Au mole ratio of 0.07:1, which indicates the exact amount of Au/Ag in the solution. EDX result shows an Ag/Au mole ratio of 0.06:1. These results are consistent with the hypothesis. 

The as-prepared CSPNPs are environment friendly and biocompatible, because chitosan is a natural and nontoxic polysaccharide. From the SEM image, some “nanodots” with the size of about 10 nm, just like the petals of popcorns, can be observed on the surface of CSPNPs. TEM image further confirms the result. 

Instruments used in this process include a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) (SIGMA) microscope for obtaining Scanning Electron Microscope images, a Nano-ZS ZEN3600 particle sizer (Malvern Instruments) for measuring Zeta potentials of CSPNPs, an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES, IRIS Intrepid II XSP, Thermo Electron Corporation) for determining concentrations of Au/Ag, and a JEOL JEM-2010 microscope for performing Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) measurements for CSPNPs."

The size of CSPNPs with a high monodispersity can be adjusted by changing the amount of regents. For instance, when the volume of CS is changed to 200 μL and 40 μL, 50 nm and 120 nm CSPNPs can be synthesized, respectively.

The composition of 80 nm CSPNPs with the original Ag/Au mole ratio of 0.08:1 was investigated by ICP-AES, EDX. To conduct ICP-AES detection, CSPNPs were isolated by centrifugation at 3500 rpm in 15 min, washed three times and subsequently dissolved in aqua regia. ICP-AES data shows an Ag/Au mole ratio of 0.07:1, which indicates the exact amount of Au/Ag in the solution. EDX result shows an Ag/Au mole ratio of 0.06:1. These results are consistent with the hypothesis. Due to the fact that CS possesses the positively charged –NH3
þ group under acidic conditions, zeta potential of the CSPNPs (80 nm) was positive (þ38.47 mV).

The article does not provide a detailed procedure for the synthesis of BiAu nanoparticles. However, it does mention that Bi–Au NPs were prepared from 13.3 nm Au NPs (0.75 nM) and bismuth ions (Bi3+; 10 mM) in 5.0 mM Tris-borate (pH 7.0). Bismuth readily conjugated to the Au NPs through metallophilic interactions or reduction reaction. The Bi–Au NPs exhibited high catalytic activity for the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated oxidation of Amplex Red (AR, 10-acetyl￾3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine).

The article also mentions that the catalytic effect of Au NPs is significantly enhanced by Bi3+ at room temperature, as compared to other tested metal ions including Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cr3+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Pd2+, Pt4+, Cu2+, Ag+, Au3+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, and Pb2+. The Bi3+-stimulated catalytic ability of Au NPs was found to be much stronger (>5-fold) than that of Hg2+ in a previous report.

The formation of Bi–Au alloys on the surface of Au NPs was confirmed by conducting highly reproducible surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SALDI–TOF MS) analyses. The peaks [Au1Bi1]+, [Au2Bi1]+, [Au1Bi2]+, [Au3Bi1]+, [Au2Bi2]+, [Au4Bi1]+, and [Au3Bi2]+ ions strongly support the formation of Bi–Au alloys on the Au NPs surfaces.

There was no statistical difference in the average particle diameter or size distribution between the Au NPs and Bi–Au NPs, as observed from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. This reveals that there is only a monolayer or submonolayer of Bi on the surface of Au NPs. The lattice d-spacing and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Bi–Au NPs were almost the same as those of Au NPs, revealing that the core structure of Au NPs did not change.

The content of Bi species on the Au NPs was quantified using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), obtaining a value of approximately 4500 Bi atoms/ions per Au NP, which was close to the surface atoms of the 13 nm Au NPs (B6600 atoms per particle). This result reveals a near monolayer of Bi–Au alloys on Au NP surfaces. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra reveal that the binding energy (BE) values for the Au 4f7/2 and Bi 4f7/2 electrons in the Bi–Au NPs were 84.2 eV and 159.5 eV, respectively. The results revealed that a high number of Bi3+ ions and Au+/Au0 coexisted on the particle surface, which greatly affected the surface properties of Au NPs."

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were also analyzed to reveal the binding energy (BE) values for the Au 4f7/2 and Bi 4f7/2 electrons in the Bi–Au NPs.

The catalytic activity of the Au NPs increased with the concentration of Bi3+ (0–10 mM), mainly because of the formation of a larger fraction of bimetallic Bi–Au complex on the particles’ surfaces. The slight decrease in the catalytic activity of Au NPs at concentrations of Bi3+ higher than 10 mM was mainly due to the formation of bismuth(III) oxide on the particles’ surfaces.

The synthesis of CoS nanoparticles (NPs) was carried out according to the procedure of Wu et al. with slight modifications. The cobalt source was cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2.6H2O) and the sulfur source was thiourea (CN2H4S). The mixed solution was prepared by dissolving CoCl2.6H2O (594.8 mg) into a mixture solution of ultrapure water (20 mL) and ethylene glycol (5 mL), and then thiourea (761.2 mg) was added. After stirring for 10 min, the mixed solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and heated for 15h at 180°C. 

Finally, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, and the black powder was collected by centrifugation and washed several times with ultrapure water and ethanol to remove unreacted reagents. The black powder of CoS was dried for 12h at 50°C under vacuum conditions. 

The ultrapure water used in the experiment was produced by a Millipore purification system (Bedford, MA, USA) and used to prepare all aqueous solutions. Absorption spectra were obtained using a model Cary 60 spectrophotometer (Agilent, USA). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for CoS were obtained using a D/max 2550 VB/PC diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) from 5 to 90°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo-ESCALAB 250XI (Thermo, USA) instrument with non-monochromated Al Ka 1486.6 eV radiation. Energy corrections were performed using the C1s peak (284.7) as reference. 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded on a field-emission microscope (JSM 7600F). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Tecnai G20 (FEI, USA). The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was recorded by Flexar/NexlON300X (PerkinElmer, USA).

The article does not specify the size of the CoS nanoparticles produced using this method. However, the characterization of the CoS was performed using various techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). 

The SEM and TEM images showed that the as-prepared CoS exhibited sphere-like nanostructures. The calculated lattice spacing from the HRTEM image were 0.252 nm and 0.298 nm, which respectively matched well with the (101) and (100) planes of the as-prepared CoS. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of CoS nanoparticles was achieved using a solvothermal method with cobalt chloride hexahydrate and thiourea as the cobalt and sulfur sources, respectively.

The synthesis of erythrocyte-like Cu1.8S nanoparticles (NPs) with a mean diameter of approximately 160 nm was achieved through a simple solvothermal chemistry process. The process involved the use of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), which is commonly used as a stabilizer in pharmaceutical products. 

The specific procedure for the synthesis of Cu1.8S nanospheres in ethylene glycol (EG) was as follows: 0.44 g of Copper(II) chloride (CuCl2), 0.19 g of thioacetamide, and 1.25 g of PVP were dispersed with stirring in 15 mL of EG. The resultant mixture was then heated at 75 C in a water-bath for 4 hours. The product was purified through a 1 kDa dialysis membrane for 2 days to remove any residual ions and small molecules. The product was then stored at 4 C for further use. The solid Cu1.8S nanospheres were concentrated by freezing at -80 C and then dried under vacuum.

The morphology of the nanoparticles was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The lattice fringes of the Cu1.8S NPs were clearly observed to be 0.19 nm by HRTEM, corresponding well to the (110) plane spacing of hexagonal Cu1.8S (JCPDS no. 47-1748). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images showed that the height of the copper sulfide NPs was approximately 4–6 nm. Elemental analysis by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry in the scanning electron microscope (SEM-EDXS) indicated that the NPs were copper deficient with a non-stoichiometric formula of Cu1.8S.

In conclusion, the synthesis of Cu1.8S NPs involves a solvothermal process using Copper(II) chloride, thioacetamide, and PVP as reagents, and ethylene glycol as the solvent. The process requires careful control of temperature and time, and the use of specific equipment for characterization and purification. The resulting nanoparticles exhibit a unique erythrocyte-like structure and are copper deficient, making them suitable for various applications."

The synthesis of FeS nanoparticles (NPs) of different sizes, including those with an average size of 4.6 nm, was described in the study by S.K. Maji et al. The process involved the decomposition of a single-source precursor complex [Fe(ACDA)3] in structure-directing solvents such as ethylene glycol (EG), ethylenediamine (EN), and ammonia (NH3).

For the synthesis of FeS NPs with an average size of 4.6 nm, the precursor complex was mixed with ethylene glycol (EG). Specifically, 1.0 g of Fe(ACDA)3 was mixed with 20 mL of EG and sonicated for 10 minutes. The mixture was then heated to boiling at 120 °C for 15 minutes, resulting in the formation of a black compound. The product was separated by centrifuging, washed repeatedly with methanol, and finally with diethyl ether. After air drying, the product was annealed under nitrogen atmosphere at 450 °C for 30 minutes.

The composition and purity of the FeS NPs were first examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Philips PW 1140 parallel beam X-ray diffractometer with Bragg-Bretano focusing geometry and monochromatic Cu K radiation. The morphological characterization was carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope working at 200 kV. The absorption spectra and photocatalytic studies were carried out on a JASCO V-530 UV-VIS spectrophotometer. Room-temperature photoluminescence measurements were performed using a Photon Technology International fluorometer.

The study also described the synthesis of FeS NPs using other solvents, such as ethylenediamine (EN) and ammonia (NH3), which resulted in NPs of different sizes and shapes. However, the specific process for the synthesis of 4.6 nm FeS NPs involved the use of ethylene glycol (EG) as the solvent."

The synthesis of FeS nanoparticles (NPs) of different sizes, including those with an average size of 4.6 nm, was carried out using a single-source precursor complex [Fe(ACDA)3] [HACDA= 2-aminocyclopentene-1-dithiocarboxylic acid]. The precursor complex was decomposed in structure-directing solvents such as ethylene glycol (EG), ethylenediamine (EN), and ammonia (NH3).

For the synthesis of FeS NPs with an average size of 4.6 nm using EG as a solvent, 1.0 g of the precursor complex was mixed with 20 mL of EG and sonicated for 10 minutes. The mixture was then heated to boiling at 120 °C for 15 minutes, resulting in the formation of a black compound. The compound was then separated using a procedure that involved cooling the mixture to room temperature, adding 20 mL of methanol, stirring for 5 minutes, and then centrifuging to separate the precipitated product. The solid product was washed repeatedly with methanol and finally with diethyl ether. After air drying, the product was annealed under a nitrogen atmosphere at 450 °C for 30 minutes.

The phase purity, morphology, structure, and properties of the FeS NPs were studied using various techniques. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Philips PW 1140 parallel beam X-ray diffractometer with Bragg-Bretano focusing geometry and monochromatic Cu K radiation ( = 1.540598A). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and selected area diffraction (SAED) patterns were collected using a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope working at 200 kV. Absorption spectra and photocatalytic studies were carried out on a JASCO V-530 UV-VIS spectrophotometer. Room-temperature photoluminescence measurements were performed using a Photon Technology International fluorometer.

The photocatalytic activity of FeS NPs for the degradation of Methylene Blue (MB) was tested at 20 °C using 40 mL aqueous solution of MB (1.65 × 10−5 M) and 20 mg of catalyst with continuous stirring. The suspension containing MB and NPs was magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 minutes to reach adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The suspension was then irradiated with a tungsten halogen lamp (200W) placed vertically at a distance of 15 cm. After a given interval of illumination, 3 mL of the aliquot was withdrawn from the mixture and centrifuged, and the concentration of the dye in the centrifugate was measured."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 7 nm ZnS nanoparticles (NPs). However, it does discuss the characterization and properties of H2TCPP-ZnS nanocomposites, which are composed of nanoparticles with diameters around 5–10 nm. 

The crystallinity and phase purities of H2TCPP-ZnS nanocomposites were examined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. Powder XRD profiles demonstrated the pure phases and good chemical stability of the nanocomposites. The as-prepared ZnS NPs exhibited a highly sphalerite structure. The relative broad feature of the peaks (FWHM) indicates the presence of smaller crystallites. The diffraction peaks at 28.6◦, 47.6◦, 56.4◦, 69.6◦ and 79.6◦ corresponded to the [111], [220], [311], [400], and [331] crystal planes of the cubic lattice, respectively.

The size and morphology of the products were imaged by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM image of the as-prepared H2TCPP-ZnS nanocomposites showed that they are composed of nanoparticles with ca. 5–10 nm in diameter. The HRTEM image of H2TCPP-ZnS nanocomposites displayed clear lattice fringes of the prepared nanocrystals, suggesting the good crystalline nature of ZnS. The interplanar spacing is ca. 0.310 nm, corresponding to the [111] lattice plane of cubic ZnS. 

XPS was also employed to analyze the formation of porphyrin functionalized ZnS nanoparticles. The wide scan XPS spectra of the H2TCPP-ZnS nanocomposites shows photoelectron lines at a binding energy of 161.92, 284.86, 399.73, 531.57, 1024.71 eV attributed to S2p, C1s, N1s, O1s and Zn2p3, respectively. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Zn and S in 2p region showed the binding energies of Zn 2p3 with strong peaks at 1024.71 eV, indicating the presence of the typical Zn2+ in the H2TCPP-ZnS nanoparticles. The binding energy of S 2p peak is at 161.92 eV, indicating the presence of S2− in the prepared samples. 

The mechanism of the formation of the NPs has been proposed. After H2TCPP molecules were dissolved into pure water by tuning pH values, H2TCPP molecules were dissociated into H2TCPP4− anions. Then, coordination bonding interaction between the O atoms of the carboxyl groups from H2TCPP molecules and the Zn2+ cations in the aqueous solution occurred. The slow decomposition of the thioacetamide generates H2S gases, which diffuse into the reaction solution, generate S2− and precipitate the Zn ions gradually, resulting in the formation of ZnS crystal nuclei. Thus, the ZnS crystal nuclei formed in the complex of Zn2+ – H2TCPP4− and grew up slowly as the experiment process. 

However, the article does not provide specific details on the quantities of reagents used, the exact conditions under which the synthesis was carried out, or the equipment used in the synthesis process."

The synthesis of Chitosan (CS) modified silver halide (AgX, X = Cl, Br, I) nanoparticles (NPs), including AgI NPs, was carried out using a precipitation method. The initial step involved mixing 20 mL of 0.1 M AgNO3 aqueous solution with 20 mL of 0.5% (m/v) chitosan solution. This mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. Following this, 20 mL of 0.15 M KX (X = Cl, Br, I) aqueous solution was added into the above solution and stirred for 3 hours. After this process, a dispersion containing CS-AgX nanoparticles was formed.

The size of the nanoparticles was determined using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The TEM images of the CS-AgX nanoproducts demonstrated that they were nanoparticles with diameters of 30−70 nm. The mean size of CS-AgCl, CS-AgBr, and CS-AgI was 48.2, 42.6, and 40.0 nm, respectively.

To conjugate the CS-AgI with folic acid (FA), free folic acid (20 mg, 0.0227 mmol) was first dissolved in 10 mL 50 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0). The solution of FA was then mixed with a 2 mL aqueous solution of (EDC) (10 mmol) and sulfo-NHS (10 mmol). After agitating overnight at room temperature in the dark, the solution of CS-AgI (10 mL) was added to the above mixture. The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. The final reaction mixture was purified by dialysis using a 3500 molecular weight cut off dialysis bag, against ultrapure water to remove the residual impurities.

The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-synthesized silver halides (CS-AgX) samples were also analyzed. It was observed that all the peaks of the sample coincide with the standard face-centered cubic AgCl (JCPDS file 31-1238), face-centered cubic AgBr (JCPDS file 06-0438), and hexagonal β-AgI phase (JCPDS file 78-1613).

The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of CS modified AgX NPs, such as CS-AgI, revealed the existence of amino groups (3400 cm−1, N−H stretching vibration) and acetylated amino groups (1648 cm−1, carbonyl stretching vibration), suggesting that CS was introduced on the surface of AgI. The spectroscopy of CS-AgI revealed a new absorption peak at around 1560 cm−1, suggesting the formation of an Ag−N bond, possibly indicating the means of attachment of CS to AgI."

The synthesis of CuCo2S4 nanoparticles (NPs) was achieved through a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method assisted with dextran to control the particle size and hydrophilicity. Dextran with a high molecular weight of 500 kDa was employed to form small and uniform CuCo2S4 NPs with an average size of about 30 nm. 

The synthesis process involved several steps. Firstly, 0.5g Dextran of different molecular weight (10 kDa, 70 kDa, 500 kDa) were added into 30 mL deionized water under vigorously magnetic stirring. Then, CuCl2·2H2O (0.25 mmol), CoCl2·6H2O (0.5 mmol) and thiourea (1.5 mmol) were added with stirring. After that, 100 µL ethylenediamine was slowly added to get a dark brown solution. 

The resulting solution was transferred to a sealed 40 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 160°C for 20 hours. After the reaction was completed, the autoclave naturally cooled to room temperature. Black precipitates were obtained by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and deionized water three times separately. The final products were obtained by drying in a lyophilizer for 6 hours. 

For comparison, naked CuCo2S4 nanoparticles were also prepared without adding dextran. In addition, CuS and CoS nanoparticles were also prepared with the same experimental conditions. 

The synthesized CuCo2S4 NPs were characterized using various techniques. The specific surface area of CuCo2S4 NPs was 39.6 m2g-1, evaluated by Brunauer – Emmett – Teller (BET) analysis. The characteristic peaks in X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern revealed their well-crystallized cubic spinel CuCo2S4 phase. Further observation of the microstructure by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) showed a clear crystalline lattice with an interplane distance of 0.237 nm, corresponding to the d-spacing of the (004) planes of cubic spinel CuCo2S4 crystal. The energy- dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectrum confirmed the existence of Cu, Co, and S elements in the as-prepared CuCo2S4 NPs. Fourier-transform infrared spectra showed the existence of dextran on the CuCo2S4 NPs."

The article provides a detailed procedure for the preparation of WSe2 nanosheets, which are similar to nanoparticles. The synthesis process involves several steps and requires specific reagents and equipment.

The reagents and materials used for the synthesis include WSe2 powder and KCl, which were added into a 50 mL round-bottom flask. Then, 20 mL of chitosan solution (1.2 mg mL1) was added to the solution. The chitosan solution was sonicated for 18 hours. The dispersion was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 minutes to remove the WSe2 powder. Finally, the dispersion was centrifuged again at 8000 rpm for 20 minutes and redispersed in a chitosan solution.

The equipment used in the synthesis process includes a sonicator, which was used to mix the solution for 18 hours, and a centrifuge, which was used to separate the WSe2 powder from the solution and to redisperse the solution.

The article does not specify the exact size of the WSe2 nanosheets produced using this method. However, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the sizes of the WSe2 nanosheets were approximately 100–300 nm. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) results show that the WSe2 nanosheets were about 10 nm in height.

The article also mentions that the UV-vis absorption spectra exhibited different characteristic peaks at 767 nm for WSe2, indicating the successful exfoliation of the WSe2 nanosheets. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis showed the typical peaks of Se and W, and the atomic ratio between Se and W was 29.02 : 12.40. This result was consistent with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which showed the presence of peaks for Se 3d at 55.0 eV and for W 4f at 32.6 and 34.7 eV.

In conclusion, the synthesis of WSe2 nanosheets requires specific reagents (WSe2 powder, KCl, and chitosan solution), equipment (a sonicator and a centrifuge), and a series of specific steps including sonication and centrifugation. The resulting WSe2 nanosheets have a size range of approximately 100–300 nm and a height of about 10 nm."

The article describes the preparation of WSe2 nanosheets, not nanoparticles. However, the process might be of interest to you. 

WSe2 powder and KCl were used as the starting materials. Specifically, 0.2 g of WSe2 powder and 0.04 g of KCl were added into a 50 mL round-bottom flask. Then, 20 mL of chitosan solution (1.2 mg mL1) was added to the solution and sonicated for 18 h.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 4400 nm LaFeO3 nanoparticles. However, it does detail the synthesis of LaFeO3 microspheres, which may be relevant. 

The synthesis of LaFeO3 microspheres was carried out via a hydrothermal method, followed by calcination. The reagents used in the synthesis included 24 mmol of citric acid (C6H8O7), 4 mmol of La(NO3)3·6H2O, and 4 mmol of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O. These were dissolved in 40 mL DDW (double-distilled water) under magnetic stirring at room temperature for 20 minutes. 

The solution was then placed in an 80 mL stainless-steel Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 12 hours. After this, the reaction products were centrifuged and washed with DDW and anhydrous ethanol several times. The products were then dried at 60 °C for 5 hours and underwent an annealing process at 800 °C for 3 hours. 

The morphology of the perovskite LaFeO3 was characterized by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) and TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy). Before calcination, LaFeO3 precursor illustrates microsphere-like structure with diameter about 5.4 ± 0.4 μm. After calcination, the LaFeO3 sphere maintained its architecture while the diameter of the spheres declined to 4.4 ± 0.3 μm, along with the appearance of mesopores on the surface. 

The EDS (Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy) elemental mapping displays that La, Fe, and O elements are homogeneously distributed throughout all the region of the mesoporous microspheres. The EDS spectrum reveals the La, Fe, and O atomic ratio is close to 1:1:3, further verifying the successful formation of LaFeO3. 

Surface area and porosity of mesoporous LaFeO3 microspheres were studied by nitrogen adsorption/desorption studies. The surface area of mesoporous LaFeO3 microspheres is 10.12 m2·g−1, while the average pore size is 32.65 nm. 

In conclusion, while the article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 4400 nm LaFeO3 nanoparticles, it does detail a method for the synthesis of LaFeO3 microspheres. This method involves a hydrothermal process, followed by calcination, and uses citric acid, La(NO3)3·6H2O, and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O as reagents."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 4400 nm LaFeO3 nanoparticles. However, it does describe the synthesis of LaFeO3 microspheres, which may be similar in process. 

The synthesis of LaFeO3 microspheres was carried out via a hydrothermal method, followed by calcination. The reagents used for this process included 24 mmol of citric acid (C6H8O7), 4 mmol of La(NO3)3·6H2O and 4 mmol of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O. These were dissolved in 40 mL DDW (double distilled water) under magnetic stirring at room temperature for 20 minutes. 

The solution was then placed in an 80 mL stainless-steel Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 12 hours. After this, the reaction products were centrifuged and washed with DDW and anhydrous ethanol several times. The products were then dried at 60 °C for 5 hours and underwent an annealing process at 800 °C for 3 hours.

The article further explains that during the hydrothermal process, Fe3+ ions were hydrolyzed to generate Fe(OH)3, while La3+ converted to La(OH)3 through alocholysis reaction in the presence of citric acid. Finally, Fe(OH)3 reacted with La(OH)3 to produce LaFeO3, with the elimination of water at high temperature.

The composition of the obtained product was confirmed by XRD (X-ray diffraction). All the diffraction peaks were in good agreement with the orthorhombic perovskite LaFeO3 standard card (JCPDS No: 37-1493). Peaks corresponding to impurities were not detected, indicating that only pure phase LaFeO3 existed. 

The detailed information of chemical bond configuration for each element was obtained from XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) measurements. The XPS measurements displayed that the La ions are La3+ in its oxide, and the peaks in Fe 2p spectra were ascribed to Fe3+. The peaks that centered at 723.0 eV and 709.5 eV were assigned to Fe2+ because of the generation of oxygen vacancies, which was further confirmed by the O 1s XPS spectrum. 

In conclusion, while the article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 4400 nm LaFeO3 nanoparticles, the process for synthesizing LaFeO3 microspheres may be similar. The process involves a hydrothermal method, followed by calcination, and uses citric acid, La(NO3)3·6H2O, and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O as reagents."

The synthesis of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1-x)4 nanocrystals (CZTSSe NCs) was performed using a solvothermal method. The materials used for the synthesis included Cu(CH3COO)2⋅H2O, Zn(CH3COO)2⋅2H2O, SnCl2, Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), monoethanolamide (C2H7NO, MEA), thioacetamide (C2H5NS, TAA), and Se powders. The specific quantities used were 0.36 mmol Cu(CH3COO)2⋅H2O, 0.25 mmol Zn(CH3COO)2⋅2H2O, 0.205 mmol SnCl2, and 1.0 g PVP. These were dissolved in 15 mL MEA under vigorous stirring to form solution A.

Meanwhile, TAA and Se powders were dissolved in 15 mL MEA to form solution B. The relative amount of TAA and Se was found to influence the solubility of Se powder in MEA. Then solution B was added dropwise into solution A slowly under magnetic stirring to form a suspension. This suspension was then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed, maintained at 180 °C for 48 h, and then cooled to room temperature naturally.

The precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed with acetone several times and dried at 60 °C in air for 6 h. The Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1-x)4 nanocrystals were finally obtained and denoted as CZTSSe-x (‘x’ stands for the molar ratio of S/(S + Se), and x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1). To obtain different CZTSSe NCs, the content of S in the final CZTSSe NCs was varied by changing the molar ratio of TAA and Se in solution B and maintaining the total molar amount of Se and S a constant at 1 mmol.

The synthesized CZTSSe NCs were characterized using various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) specific surface area analysis, and zeta potential measurements."

The synthesis of bimetallic PdCu nanoparticles was achieved through a microwave-assisted wet-chemical synthetic approach. The specific size of the nanoparticles, such as 5 nm, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, the process of synthesis is detailed.

The metal precursor mixture was prepared by combining 5 mL of 0.1 M K2PdCl4 solution and 5 mL of 0.1 M CuSO4 solution. This 10 mL mixture was quickly injected into a 250 mL three-neck flask containing 50 mL of 0.1 M NaBH4. The three-neck flask was placed in an XH-100A microwave synthesizer (Beijing Xianghu Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd.) for the reaction to occur.

The reaction was performed at 60 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes, with a microwave power of 600 W. The resulting product, black PdCu, was collected by centrifugation and washed with water and ethanol alternately several times. For comparison, pure Pd was also prepared under identical conditions, but without CuSO4 in the synthesis system.

The synthesized PdCu was characterized by XRD measurements, which were conducted to differentiate the bimetallic PdCu from the pure Pd counterpart. The synthesized PdCu only produced recognizable Pd diffraction signals with much wider FWHM and lower intensity, and no other impurity peak, such as metallic Cu and its oxides, was observed in the PdCu XRD pattern. This indicated that the Cu entity had been immersed into the Pd lattice facilitated by microwave irradiation.

The insertion of Cu atoms with a smaller atomic radius caused the crystal defects of Pd, which reduced the crystallinity of PdCu, thus resulting in the lower intensity and wider FWHM. These diffraction peaks had an apparent shift to larger 2θ positions compared with the pure Pd, which also resulted from the incorporation of Cu atoms into the Pd lattice in place of Pd atoms.

In conclusion, a bimetallic PdCu material with Cu and Pd atoms interpenetrated well was obtained via the microwave-assisted synthetic method. The synthesized PdCu had a unique coral-like structure, which provided abundant active sites and surfaces for reaction, and was more stable compared to independent nanoparticles."

The synthesis of bimetallic PdCu nanoparticles was achieved through a microwave-assisted wet-chemical synthetic approach. The chemicals and materials used in the synthesis include K2PdCl4 and NaBH4, which were obtained from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. CuSO4 was provided by Sinopharm Chemical Regent Co., Ltd. Deionized water was utilized throughout the study. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received.

In detail, 10 mL of the metal precursor mixture consisting of 5 mL 0.1 M K2PdCl4 solution and 5 mL 0.1 M CuSO4 solution was quickly injected into a 250 mL three-neck flask containing 50 mL 0.1 M NaBH4 with a wild stir. The three-neck flask was in an XH-100A microwave synthesizer (Beijing Xianghu Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd.) for reaction. The reaction was performed at 60o C for 5 min, along with a microwave power of 600 W. 

The black PdCu product was collected by centrifugation and washed with water and ethanol alternately for several times. For comparison, pure Pd was also prepared under identical conditions, with no CuSO4 in the synthesis system. 

The synthesized PdCu only produces recognizable Pd diffraction signals with much wider FWHM and lower intensity, and no other impurity peak, such as metallic Cu and its oxides, is observed in the PdCu XRD pattern. This phenomenon indicates that the Cu entity has been immersed into the Pd lattice facilitated by microwave irradiation. The insertion of Cu atoms with a smaller atomic radius causes the crystal defects of Pd, which reduces the crystallinity of PdCu, thus resulting in the lower intensity and wider FWHM. 

The coral-like structure of PdCu has the following advantages: (1) in comparison with independent nanoparticles that are prone to agglomeration, the interconnected structure in the synthesized PdCu nanozyme makes it more stable; (2) the branches in the coral-like structure provide abundant active sites and surfaces for reaction; (3) besides, the unique structure can be easily obtained by the microwave-assisted wet-chemical approach, with no surfactant or capping agent required.

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). However, it does mention that the size of the AuNPs can be controlled by changing the concentration of the protein casein. For instance, AuNPs prepared in the presence of 0.02 mg mL1 casein have an average size of 8.7 nm. The AuNP size decreases to 2.8 nm when the casein concentration increases to 0.5 mg mL1. 

The article also mentions that the as-prepared AuNPs are well monodispersed and are capped by protein, as indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data. The average diameter of the AuNPs is 4.2 ± 0.5 nm, as judged from image analysis of 300 individual particles. 

The FT-IR spectra of native b-casein and b-casein stabilized AuNPs are also discussed. For b-casein, the appearance of a band at 1645 cm1 indicates an unordered structure of b-casein. However, the predominant band centering at 1656 cm1 indicates that the binding of b-casein to AuNPs has made the transformation from unordered structure to a-helix structure of b-casein. 

Furthermore, casein consists of a highly repetitive sequence of amino acids of aspartic acid (Asp) and glutamic acid (Glu) (17% Asp and 23% of all residues in casein), and the carboxylic group provides the potential for gold complexing. As expected, the band at 1447 and 1398 cm1 due to COO of Asp and Glu residues changes much in the CM stabilized AuNPs, which indicates that Asp and Glu residues play important roles in the stabilization of AuNPs.

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of the Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). However, it does mention that the size of the AuNPs can be controlled by changing the concentration of the protein, specifically b-casein, used in the preparation. 

For instance, AuNPs prepared in the presence of 0.02 mg mL1 casein have an average size of 8.7 nm. The size of the AuNPs decreases to 2.8 nm when the casein concentration increases to 0.5 mg mL1. The UV/vis absorption spectra of AuNPs synthesized at different protein concentrations further demonstrate that the size of AuNPs increases with the decrease of casein concentration to 0.02 mg mL1. When the b-casein concentration increases to 0.5 mg mL1, the size of the gold colloids decreases to less than 4 nm. 

The as-prepared AuNPs are well monodispersed and are stabilized by b-casein. The binding of b-casein to AuNPs transforms the unordered structure of b-casein to a-helix structure. Casein consists of a highly repetitive sequence of amino acids of aspartic acid (Asp) and glutamic acid (Glu), and the carboxylic group provides the potential for gold complexing. 

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data revealed that gold, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are present at the surface of AuNPs, indicating that the AuNPs are capped by protein. The main peak (Au 4f7/2) of AuNPs demonstrates that the resulting AuNP solution does not include any unreacted species (such as AuCl4). 

The CM–AuNPs are found to be stable over 6 months and do not show any signs of aggregation at 4 C. Here, b-casein can stabilize AuNPs by both the electrostatic effect and the steric effect. 

In conclusion, while the article does not provide a detailed synthesis procedure for the AuNPs, it does highlight the importance of protein concentration in controlling the size of the nanoparticles and their stability."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 2 nm or other size Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). However, it does mention that the size of the AuNPs can be controlled by varying the concentration of b-casein, a protein that is used to stabilize the nanoparticles. 

For instance, AuNPs prepared in the presence of 0.02 mg mL1 casein have an average size of 8.7 nm. When the casein concentration increases to 0.5 mg mL1, the AuNP size decreases to 2.8 nm. The UV/vis absorption spectra of AuNPs synthesized at different protein concentrations show a red shift of lmax (from 512 nm at 0.1 mg mL1 to 535 nm at 0.02 mg mL1), further demonstrating that the size of AuNPs increases with the decrease of casein concentration to 0.02 mg mL1. When the b-casein concentration increases to 0.5 mg mL1, no sharper absorbance peak is observed within the UV-vis range, indicating the size of the gold colloids decreases to less than 4 nm. 

The FT-IR and fluorescence spectra measurements were used to understand the surface properties of as-prepared CM–AuNPs with different sizes. The predominant band centering at 1648 cm1 for CM–AuNP (2.8 nm) indicates the unordered structure of b-casein. For CM–AuNP (8.7 nm) and CM–AuNP (4.2 nm), the interaction between AuNPs and b-casein is strong due to the large size of AuNPs. This makes the natively unordered structure transform into a-helix structure of b-casein.

The synthesis of Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) is described in the experimental section of the article. The Pt nanoparticles were prepared first by mixing 0.4 mL 3 mM H2PtCl6 solution with 40 µL of β-casein aqueous solution with a desired concentration in 2.96mL10mM PBS buffer (pH=7). After stirring 90 min at 45℃, 0.6 mL of ice cold 10 mM NaBH4 was added under stirring. After the complete reaction (5 h), the solution was dialysed with water for 24 h to remove excess β-casein.

The chemicals and materials used for the synthesis include β-Casein, which was purchased from Sigma (>99%). Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate tetrahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O, 99%), 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and 2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents used were of analytical grade from Beijing Company, and ultrapure Millipore water (18.2 MΩ) was used as the solvent. All glassware was washed with aqua regia (HCl: HNO3 in 3:1 ratio by volume), and rinsed with ethanol and ultrapure water. β-Casein powders were dispersed in water under stirring at 50 ◦C, and the dispersions were stored at 4◦C overnight to allow complete hydration.

The Pt nanoparticles were characterized using various techniques. The reduction of platinum ions ([PtCl6]2-) can be confirmed by UV/vis spectroscopy. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image indicates that the synthesized PtNPs are sphere-like shape and the average size of the nanoparticles is calculated to be about 3.8 nm, as judged from image analysis of 200 individual particles. According to the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Pt nanoparticles, the measured lattice fringe spacing is 0.23 nm, which is consistent with the (111) interplane spacing of face centered-cubic Pt NPs.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data revealed that Pt, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are present at the surface of PtNPs, indicating that the PtNPs are capped by protein. The binding energy of the electron on the Pt 4f7/2 orbital of the nanoparticles can be deconstructed into Pt2+ and Pt0 components with the binding energies of 72.2 eV (63.74%) and 71.0 eV (36.26%), respectively.

The synthesis of Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) of approximately 3.8 nm in size was described in the article.

The Pt nanoparticles were synthesized using sodium borohydride as a reducing agent in the presence of β-casein. The reduction of platinum ions ([PtCl6]2-) can be confirmed by UV/vis spectroscopy. The absorption peaks of platinum ions at 260 nm disappeared as the metallic Pt nanoparticles were produced, and the prepared β-casein-PtNP (CM-PtNP) obtained appears a light brown color. 

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image indicates that CM-PtNP is sphere-like shape and the average size of CM-PtNP is calculated to be about 3.8 nm, as judged from image analysis of 200 individual particles.

The synthesis of Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) with a cubic shape and an edge length of approximately 15.3 nm was achieved using a one-step coprecipitation method. The process involved the use of certain chemicals and materials, as well as specific equipment for the synthesis and subsequent characterization of the nanoparticles.

The chemicals and materials used for the nanoparticle synthesis included FeCl3·6H2O, K4[Fe(CN)6]·3H2O, and citric acid. The volume of 20 mL of the aqueous 1.0 mmol L−1 FeCl3 and 0.5 mmol L−1 citric acid was heated to 55 °C and mixed with 20 mL of 1.0 mmol L−1 K4[Fe(CN)6] and 0.5 mmol L−1 citric acid under vigorous stirring. The resulting mixture was stirred for 10 minutes and then cooled down to room temperature.

For the characterization of the synthesized nanoparticles, various techniques were employed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to reveal the cubic shape of the PBNPs and to measure the length of the edge of the PBNP cubes. Dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy (AFM), gel electrophoresis, and UV/VIS spectroscopy were also used for nanomaterial characterization.

The catalytic properties of the PBNPs were measured at laboratory temperature in 96 well microtiter plate using the Synergy 2 reader from BioTek. The final concentration of PBNPs was 6.7 × 10−12 mol L−1. The rate of oxidation of TMB to the yellow product (vTMB450) after the addition of sulfuric acid was more typically measured in previous studies.

In conclusion, the synthesis of Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) of a specific size involves a one-step coprecipitation method, the use of specific chemicals and materials, and the application of various characterization techniques. The process also requires the measurement of the catalytic properties of the nanoparticles using specific equipment and conditions."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of Fe4(Fe(CN)6)3 nanoparticles. The information provided in the article pertains to the preparation and characterization of Prussian Blue Nanoparticles (PBNPs), not Fe4(Fe(CN)6)3 nanoparticles. The PBNPs were prepared using simple colloidal chemistry with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), which is a common auxiliary material in pharmaceuticals, as a stabilizer. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the synthesized PBNPs are cubic particles with an average size of ca. 50 nm. The particles have a crystalline structure with strong and typical diffraction spots. The calculated d spaces are 0.49 nm for (200), 0.35 nm for (220), and 0.25 nm for (400). PBNPs can be well dispersed in water with an average hydrodynamic diameter of 92.93 nm and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.092. The UV/VIS absorption spectrum of PBNPs shows an obvious characteristic peak of PB at approximately 700 nm, which can be attributed to the intermetallic charge-transfer band from Fe2+ to Fe3+ in PB. The PBNPs exhibited a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) absorption peak at 2090 cm-1, which is characteristic of CN stretching in the Fe2+-CN-Fe3+ bond of PB, and a peak at 1670 cm-1, indicative of C=O stretching in the PVP amide unit, which is consistent with that of pure PVP."

The synthesis of IrNPs (Iridium Nanoparticles) involves several steps and requires specific reagents and equipment. 

The first step is the preparation of sacrificial Ag nanoplates. For this, 0.152 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW = 29 kDa) is dissolved in 26.25 mL of deionized (DI) water. Then, 250 µL of 10 mM AgNO3, and 300 µL of 30 mM sodium citrate are added to a transparent 50 mL borosilicate glass vial. Following this, 60 µL of 30% hydrogen peroxide and 250 µL of 100 mM NaBH4 aqueous solution are subsequently added. After 3 hours of incubation, the solution color changes to blue and proceeds to the growth step without purification. 

In the growth step, 1 mL of 100 mM L-ascorbic acid and 330 µL of 75 mM citrate are added to the as-synthesized Ag nanoseed solution-contained 50 mL vial. The growth solution is prepared, which is composed of 20 mL of 1 mM AgNO3 and 125 µL of 100 mM citric acid. The prepared growth solution is added dropwise to the seed solution at the rate of 0.2 mL·s-1, followed by the color change to deep blue with the additional incubation for 15 min.

The next step is the synthesis of IrNPs by hydrothermal galvanic replacement. 20 mL of as-synthesized Ag nanoplates and 3 mL of 10 mM IrCl3 stock solution are homogeneously mixed in a Teflon-lined autoclave vessel. Using the stainless steel autoclave, the mixture is heated for 1 hour at 200 °C with gentle magnetic stirring. After the reaction, the product is cooled down to room temperature naturally, and the dark-brown colored product is purified by centrifugation for 10 min at 9000 rpm. To remove the unreacted precursors and dissolved ions, the product is further washed for 3 times with deionized water. Finally, purified IrNPs are re-dispersed in 5 mL of deionized water for further use.

The morphology of IrNPs is characterized by energy-filtering TEM (LIBRA 120, Carl Zeiss, Germany). HR and HAADF-STEM/EDS mapping are accomplished by a Tecnai F20 (FEI, USA). XPS analysis is performed by photoelectron spectrometer system (K-Alpha+, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). XRD is performed by SmartLab (Rigaku corporation, Japan). UV-Vis-NIR spectra are obtained by Lambda-465 (PerkinElmer, USA), BioPhotometer D30 spectrophotometer (Eppendort Co., Hamburg, Germany), and SynergyMx (Biotek, UK). Hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential are identified by Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, UK). Cell images are obtained by Ti-inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Co., Japan) and a CoolSNAP cf charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Photometrics, USA) with Metamorph image analysis software (Molecular Devices, USA).

The TEM image of IrNPs shows particles with rough surface morphology and a transverse diameter of ~90 nm. The structure and composition of IrNPs, including the crystallinity and elemental oxidation states, are further verified through X-ray techniques and high-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM)."

The synthesis of IrNPs (Iridium Nanoparticles) with a transverse diameter of approximately 90 nm was achieved through a hydrothermal galvanic replacement process. The initial step involved the homogeneous mixing of 20 mL of as-synthesized Ag nanoplates and 3 mL of 10 mM IrCl3 stock solution in a Teflon-lined autoclave vessel. The mixture was then heated for 1 hour at 200 °C with gentle magnetic stirring using a stainless steel autoclave. This temperature was chosen to achieve a spontaneous replacement reaction and subsequent secondary growth of IrNPs due to the high-energy environment.

After the reaction, the product was cooled down to room temperature naturally, and the dark-brown colored product was purified by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 9000 rpm. To remove the unreacted precursors and dissolved ions, the product was further washed three times with deionized water. Finally, the purified IrNPs were re-dispersed in 5 mL of deionized water for further use.

The structure and composition of IrNPs, including the crystallinity and elemental oxidation states, were further verified through X-ray techniques and high-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM). According to the deconvoluted Ir 4f and Ag 3d X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), IrNPs are composed of metallic Ir (Ir0: 60.8 and 63.8 eV for 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively) and Ag (Ag0: 367.3 and 373.3 eV for 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively), and a small quantity of IrO2 (Ir4+: 61.6 and 64.8 eV for 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively) due to surface oxidation. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the IrNP film on Si wafer also indicated the alloyed nature of the nanoparticles."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of MoS2 nanoparticles (NPs). It only mentions that MoS2 quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized through a hydrothermal method, where (NH4)2MoS4 and glucose were employed as Mo/S source and reducing agent, respectively. However, the article does not provide specific details such as the quantities of the reagents used, the temperature and time for the hydrothermal process, or any post-synthesis treatments. 

The characterization of the synthesized MoS2 QDs was done using various techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to determine the size and uniformity of the QDs. The QDs were found to be highly uniform and monodisperse with a narrow size distribution of 2.72 ± 0.54 nm. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) was used to confirm the high crystallinity of the MoS2 QDs. 

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the chemical state and composition of the QDs. The XPS results showed that Mo and S could be detected, along with C, N, and O, likely from the precursors involved in hydrothermal synthesis. UV-vis measurement and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy were also used to further characterize the QDs. 

The peroxidase-like activity of the MoS2 QDs was studied using an ordinary UV−vis spectrophotometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to show the sizes and morphologies of MoS2 QDs under different conditions. 

However, the article does not provide a detailed procedure for the synthesis of the MoS2 NPs. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to your question based on the information given in the article."

However, the article does not provide specific details such as the quantities of the reagents used, the temperature and time for the hydrothermal process, or any post-synthesis treatments. 

The article does provide detailed characterization of the synthesized MoS2 QDs. They were characterized by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV−vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. A typical TEM image showed that the MoS2 QDs were highly uniform and monodisperse in a narrow size distribution of 2.72 ± 0.54 nm. The highly paralleled and ordered lattice fringe was observed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image, confirming the high crystallinity of the MoS2 QDs. The lattice fringe spacing is 0.21 nm, which matches well with the (006) lattice of the hexagonal crystal MoS2.

XPS measurements were performed to investigate the chemical state and composition of the QDs. The XPS survey spectrum showed that Mo and S could be detected, together with C, N and O, likely from the precursors involved in hydrothermal synthesis. High-resolution Mo 3d spectrum showed two characteristic peaks at 227.8 and 232.5 eV, which can be assigned to Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2, respectively. This result suggests that the dominance of Mo is the 4+ oxidation state. The peaks at 163.4 and 164.7 eV in high-resolution S 2p spectrum can be assigned to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 orbitals of S2-. The peak located at 168.7 eV is possibly ascribed to S6+, which may result from slight oxidation during the reaction process.

UV-vis measurement revealed that the absorption spectrum of the MoS2 QDs could be distinguished from that of the precursors. In addition, strong blue PL of the QDs was also observed, where the maximal excitation and emission wavelengths are located at 366 nm and 465 nm, respectively. Further studies showed that the PL of the QDs was excitation-dependent, and the quantum yield of 1.43% was measured using quinine sulfate as a reference.

In conclusion, while the article provides detailed characterization of the synthesized MoS2 QDs, it does not provide specific details on the synthesis process."

The article describes the synthesis of Carbon Quantum Dots (CQDs), which are a type of carbon nanoparticles. The synthesis process begins with the collection of 500 µL latexes from the E. milii plant. These latexes are then dissolved in 100 mL of ultrapure water and ultrasonicated for 15 minutes in a beaker.

The synthesis of Ti3C2 nanosheets, which have a diameter mainly distributed in 35–155 nm with the average size of 103 nm, is described in the article. The synthesis process is a two-step procedure. 

In the first step, Al atoms are extracted from Ti3AlC2 precursors by KOH, breaking the metallic bonding between adjacent Ti3C2 layers. After the extraction of Al layers, gaps are produced from the edges that spread inside. The following ultrasonication was introduced to ensure complete delamination. 

The etching process of Ti3C2 nanosheets may abide by the following simplified reactions:
Ti3AlC2 + KOH + H2O = Ti3C2 + KAlO2 + 3/2H2 (1)
Ti3C2 + 2H2O = Ti3C2(OH)2 + H2 (2)

The resulting Ti3C2 nanosheets are most probably terminated with –OH functional groups. XPS spectra indicate the existence of Ti–C (464.4 cm1) and Ti–O (458.5 cm1) bonds, as well as the O 1s signal (530.3 cm1), which is evidence for the formation of Ti3C2(OH)2 after treatment. 

In addition, the FTIR spectrum illustrates a broad band centered at 3400 cm1 and another peak at 1639 cm1, verifying the surface termination of hydroxyl groups and the resonance peak of CQO groups. Meanwhile, intercalated water molecules also exist. All the above-mentioned results demonstrated the successful synthesis of Ti3C2 nanosheets terminated with –OH groups.

The microscopic features of Ti3C2 nanosheets studied by TEM exhibit a two-dimensional thin-sheet morphology. From the periphery of the sheets, layer-shaped edges were obvious. The corresponding SAED pattern and HRTEM images indicate the high crystallinity of the Ti3C2 nanosheets. The AFM image provides a relatively precise thickness of the Ti3C2 nanosheets at around 5 nm.

The article does not provide specific instructions for synthesizing 180 nm Ti3C2 nanoparticles. However, it does describe the synthesis of few-layered Ti3C2 nanosheets, which are two-dimensional structures, not nanoparticles. 

The synthesis of Ti3C2 nanosheets was carried out through a two-step procedure.

The synthesis of HS-PtNPs, or Heparin-capped Platinum Nanoparticles, is described in the provided text. The process begins with HS powder, accurately weighed at 0.05 g, which is added to 50 mL of 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid solution. This mixture is stirred sufficiently to completely dissolve the HS powder, resulting in a 0.1% (m/v) HS solution.

Next, 2 mL of 10 mM H2PtCl6 is added to 47 mL of the HS solution. This mixture is then vortexed in the dark for 30 minutes. Following this, 1 mL of freshly prepared 0.1 M sodium borohydride solution is added dropwise, a process that is completed within 5 minutes. The mixture is then stirred in a dark place for 90 minutes to prepare the HS-PtNPs. The final products are stored at around 4 °C in the dark.

The HS-PtNPs are formed by reducing H2PtCl6 in HS using NaBH4. It was found that bare PtNPs exhibit weak stability and show distinct aggregation in solution, while the as-synthesized solution exhibited excellent colloidal stability when HS was introduced into the preparation process. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum indicated an existence of Pt in the HS-PtNPs.

The average diameter of HS-PtNPs was found to be 4.8 ± 0.6 nm, as shown by the TEM image. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image shows that HS-PtNPs possessed a 0.30 nm continuous lattice spacing. The formation of Pt in HS-PtNPs was further verified by XPS. As shown in this characteristic spectrum, the Pt4f7/2 peak could be deconvoluted into two different peaks, which were centered at binding energies of 75.0 and 78.9 eV, and attributed to Pt4+ and Pt0, respectively. The relative intensities of the Pt species suggested that HS-PtNPs were composed of 57% metallic Pt4+ species and 42% Pt0 species.

The synthesis process was conducted using a Nicolet Avatar 360 FT-IR spectrophotometer, a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer, an RP-C18 (250 × 4.6 mm, 3 µm; Agilent) for high performance liquid chromatographic separation and other impurities, and an electrochemical workstation (CHI660C, Shanghai Chenhua Device Company, China) for electrochemical measurements."

The synthesis of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) is described in the article under the section ""Preparation and characterization of Pd-DTT"". The Pd-DTT nanozyme was synthesized via reducing the K2PdCl4 precursor with NaBH4, during which a certain amount of DTT was added as a stabilizer and modifier. The detailed procedure is as follows: 10 mL DTT (1 mM) and 10 mL K2PdCl4 (25 mM) were first mixed in 10 mL deionized water and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Then, 10 mL NaBH4 (125 mM) was dropwise added to the above mixture. The solution was kept under a mild stir for 0.5 h. The products were washed with deionized water and collected. After being dried in a vacuum oven at 50oC for 12 h, the Pd-DTT nanozyme was obtained. 

The characterization of the synthesized Pd-DTT was done using several methods. The crystal structure of the obtained products was characterized by XRD. The shape of Pd-DTT was observed by TEM. A large number of Pd nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 3.8 nm are observed. The high-resolution TEM image displays that the interplanar spacing of the synthesized Pd-DTT is 0.227 nm, which is in consistent with the theoretical value (0.224 nm). These particles are linked each other because of the interaction between Pd and the dual sulfydryl groups in DTT. 

The FTIR spectra of DTT and Pd-DTT were compared. In Pd-DTT, the peaks at 2970 and 2930 cm-1 are attributed to the alkyl groups in DTT, indicating that DTT has been successfully anchored onto Pd nanoparticles. However, the peak at 2550 cm-1 originating from the dual sulfydryl groups in DTT cannot be identified in Pd-DTT. This supports that the dual sulfydryl groups in DTT have bound to two Pd particles, forming a Pd─DTT─Pd structure. 

In the full XPS, the elements O, Pd, C and S can be well observed, also indicating the successful modification of DTT on Pd surface. The fine Pd 3d XPS and other characterization methods were performed on an ESCALAB-MKII spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). 

In conclusion, the synthesis of Pd nanoparticles involves the reduction of K2PdCl4 precursor with NaBH4, with DTT serving as a stabilizer and modifier. The synthesized Pd-DTT nanozyme was characterized using XRD, TEM, FTIR, and XPS."

The synthesis of Pd@Ir core-shell cubes/octahedra, which are nanocrystals, is described in the provided text. The core-shell structured Pd@Ir nanocrystals were synthesized according to the published literature. 

Firstly, 100 mg of PVP and 60 mg of AA were dissolved in 10 mL of EG. Then, the mixture was added to a three-necked flask, which had been preheated in an oil bath at 100 °C for one hour. Then, 0.8 mL of 14 nm Pd cubic seeds (4.0 mg mL-1) was added. Meanwhile, the reaction temperature was increased quickly, and when the temperature reached to 200 °C, 4 mL of Na3IrCl6ïxH2O solution (0.5 mg mL-1, dissolved in EG) was injected into the flask at a rate of 0.5 mL h-1. The reaction was continued for 10 min after the end of the injection. The flask was transferred to an ice water bath to stop the reaction. The product was collected by centrifugation through washing several times with water. Finally, the sample was dispersed in water for storage and analysis.

The characterization of Pd@Ir core-shell cubes/octahedra was done using TEM (Tecnai G20 spirit BioTwin, FEI, USA) and HRTEM (Tecnai G2 F20, FEI, USA) to characterize the morphology of the nanostructures. EDX elemental mapping was performed using a Talos F200X microscope (FEI, USA). The contents of metal elements were determined by ICP-MS (Element 2, Thermo Finnigan, Germany).

The synthesis of the 14 nm Pd cubic seeds used in the process is also described. 105 mg of PVP, 60 mg of AA, 5 mg of KBr and 185 mg of KCl were dissolved in 8 mL of ultrapure water at room temperature, and the mixture was preheated at 80 °C for 10 min. Then, 3 mL of Na2PdCl4 solution (57 mg) was added. The reaction was kept at 80 °C for 3 h and then cooled to room temperature. After that, the sample was washed with acetone once and water three times via centrifugation. Finally, the obtained Pd cubic seeds were stored in water. The 14 nm Pd cubes were synthesized by a similar method, except that only 300 mg of KBr was introduced. 

The synthesis of 14 nm Pd octahedra is also described. 8 mL of 13 mg mL-1 PVP aqueous solution, 100 M of formaldehyde and 300 M of 6 nm Pd cubic seeds (1.8 mg mL-1) were placed in a three-necked flask and preheated at 60 °C for 10 min. Then, 3 mL of 8 mg mL-1 Na2PdCl4 aqueous solution was added by pipette. The reaction temperature was maintained at 60 °C for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was washed several times with water and acetone. Finally, the as-prepared Pd octahedra were dispersed in ethylene glycol (EG) for further use."

The flask was then transferred to an ice water bath to stop the reaction. The product was collected by centrifugation through washing several times with water. Finally, the sample was dispersed in water for storage and analysis.

Characterization of the synthesized Pd@Ir core-shell NPs was performed using TEM (Tecnai G20 spirit BioTwin, FEI, USA) and HRTEM (Tecnai G2 F20, FEI, USA) to characterize the morphology of the NPs. EDX elemental mapping was performed using a Talos F200X microscope (FEI, USA). The contents of metal elements were determined by ICP-MS (Element 2, Thermo Finnigan, Germany).

The synthesis process involves the use of various reagents including PVP, AA, EG, Pd cubic seeds, and Na3IrCl6ïxH2O solution. The process also involves the use of specific equipment such as a three-necked flask, an oil bath, and various characterization tools including TEM, HRTEM, and ICP-MS. The synthesis process also requires specific temperature and time conditions, with the reaction temperature reaching up to 200 °C and the reaction time lasting for 10 minutes after the end of the injection."

The synthesis of SeNPs (selenium nanoparticles) of 38.7 nm or other sizes was achieved through a modified process as described in the literature. The materials used for the synthesis were all of analytical grade and used without further purification. These included ethanol, acetic acid, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), glutathione (GSH), and sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) which were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Biosharp (Hefei, China) and TMB was purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Double-distilled water was used throughout the whole experiment.

The process of preparation of the SeNPs involved mixing 5 mL of 10 mmol/L Na2SeO3 with 400 mg BSA under vigorous stirring, and then adding 20 mL of 10 mmol/L GSH into the mixture. The color of the mixture turned into orange-red after 130 µL of 1 mol/L NaOH was rapidly injected, indicating that the SeNPs were formed. The colloidal was then dialyzed using a dialysis bag (MW cutoff 3500) against double-distilled water for 48 hours with the water changing every 24 hours to separate the oxidized glutathione (GSSG). The obtained solution was then centrifuged to abandon the suspension, while the red precipitate was dispersed into distilled water and stored at 4 °C.

SeNPs with different sizes can be synthesized by adding different amounts of BSA into the redox system. The as-obtained SeNPs were characterized by TEM, XRD, DLS, XPS, IR, and UV–Vis absorption. TEM sample was prepared by placing a drop of the colloidal dispersion onto a copper grid coated with a perforated carbon film, followed by evaporating the solvent at room temperature. The TEM graphs were obtained on a Tecnai (G2 20, FEI Co., Netherlands) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The average particle size and the distribution were determined from about 200 particles of the enlarged micrographs. The mean hydrodynamic diameter of SeNPs in aqueous solution was obtained using a DLS instrument (LB-550, Horiba, Ltd. Japan). 

In conclusion, the synthesis of SeNPs of 38.7 nm or other sizes involves a series of steps including the mixing of Na2SeO3 with BSA, the addition of GSH, the injection of NaOH, dialysis, and centrifugation. The size of the SeNPs can be controlled by adjusting the amount of BSA added into the redox system. The synthesized SeNPs are then characterized using various techniques such as TEM, XRD, DLS, XPS, IR, and UV–Vis absorption."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 5 nm Pt nanoparticles. It does, however, describe the formation of Pt nanoparticles and Pt–Se nanostructures. The H2PtCl6 aqueous solution was used, which was pale yellow and showed a peak at about 265 nm in its UV–Vis spectrum due to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer transition of the [PtCl6]2- ions. After the addition of the reduction agent NaBH4, the color of the solution turned into dark brown within 30 minutes. The UV–Vis spectrum showed the peak at 265 nm disappeared, indicating that the [PtCl6]2- ions were completely reduced and the Pt nanoparticles were formed.

The mixture solution of H2PtCl6 and Na2SeO3 showed nearly the same absorption spectrum with H2PtCl6 aqueous solution, indicating that there was no interaction with H2PtCl6 and Na2SeO3 before reaction. After the addition of the reduction agent ascorbic acid, the peak at 265 nm also disappeared and the absorption from the visible region to the ultraviolet increased along with the formation of a dark brown solution. It was worth noting that there appeared an absorption peak at nearly 300 nm, which was relevant to the formation vibration of Se nanoparticles. Based on the UV–Vis spectrum of Pt–Se nanostructures, it could be seen that Pt nanoparticles and Se nanoparticles coexist during the process of Pt–Se nanostructure formation.

The XPS sample was prepared by spreading the colloidal ethanol dispersion on a glass plate and dried under room temperature, and the XPS patterns were operated on an Axis-ultra Dld-600 W (Kratos, Japan) photoelectron spectrometer. UV–Vis absorption spectra were collected on a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550) in the wavelength range of 200–600 nm. Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were obtained on a JASCO FP-6200 fluorimeter.

However, the article does not provide specific details on the quantities of reagents used, the exact conditions of the reactions, or the methods used to control the size of the nanoparticles."

The synthesis of Iridium nanoparticles (IrNPs) with an average diameter of 2.5 ± 0.5 nm was carried out using sodium citrate as the stabilizer and NaBH4 as the reducing agent. The preparation process was conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent the influence of oxygen. 

The detailed procedure is as follows: Sodium citrate solution (3 mL, 0.034 M) was mixed with iridium chloride solution (20 mL, 1 mM). NaOH solution (1 M) was added dropwise to adjust the pH of the mixture to 7–9. The mixture was refluxed under vigorous stirring for 20 minutes and the color of the solution changed to faint yellow. Freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (1 mL, 0.1 M) was added and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes with the heater switched off. The color of the solution gradually changed to black, indicating the formation of colloidal IrNPs.

The colloidal IrNPs were purified by adding the appropriate amount of ethanol and centrifuging the mixture at 3357 rcf for 5 minutes. The precipitate was washed three times with ethanol, and the obtained product was dried in a vacuum at 45 °C. A stock solution (1.5 mg·mL−1) was prepared by dissolving the powders in ultrapure water and stored at room temperature for subsequent use. The concentration of Ir was measured to be 4.94 mM according to the ICP-MS results.

The morphology and size of the IrNPs were characterized using High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The HRTEM images showed that the IrNPs exhibit good monodispersity and the average diameter is about 2.5 ± 0.5 nm. The XRD patterns indicated the presence of {200}, {220}, and {311} facets of iridium, which are associated with higher catalytic activity.

In conclusion, the synthesis of IrNPs involves the use of sodium citrate as a stabilizer and NaBH4 as a reducing agent, with the process carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting IrNPs have an average diameter of 2.5 ± 0.5 nm and exhibit excellent oxidase-like property."

The synthesis of MnFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) was carried out using the co-precipitation method, as reported by Zhang et al. with some modifications. The metal precursors, FeCl3 and MnCl2, were dissolved in 5 mL of deionized water at concentrations of 0.8 and 0.4 M, respectively. These solutions were slowly mixed in a 250-mL stopped bottle under magnetic stirring and heated to 100 ◦C in a water bath. 

Afterward, 7 M NaOH was added to the mixture to reach a 0.2 M ratio between metal cations and OH-. A dark brown precipitate was formed and digested for two hours at 100 ◦C. The particles were magnetically separated and washed with deionized water three times. The obtained particles were frozen to − 80 ◦C and then freeze-dried. The dried NPs powder was stored for further assays.

The acquisition of micrographs and elemental distribution of MnFe2O4 NPs was carried out by Scanning electronic microscopy - Energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) in a HITACHI SU3500 microscopy (Japan) at 15.0 kV. Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM) analysis was done in a JEOL JEM 2100 LaB6 TEM at 200 kV. The size distribution of MnFe2O4 NPs was calculated from TEM images employing ImageJ software. The nanoparticle size was measured from TEM images, which showed a narrow size distribution of 3.16 ± 0.62 nm.

The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis of MnFe2O4 NPs was performed using a STADI-P (Stoe®, Darmstadt, Germany) diffractometer operating at room temperature, 50 kV, 40 mA and using MoKα1 (λ = 0.7093 Å) radiation. The X-rays photons were collected by a Mythen 1 K (Dectris®, Baden, Switzerland) detector. Data were recorded in a powdered sample loaded into a 0.3-mm-diameter special glass 14 capillary (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany), in the 2θ range from 5.0◦ to 60.485◦, with step sizes of 0.015º and a counting time of 100 s at each 0.785◦. 

The FTIR spectrum of MnFe2O4 NPs was obtained in a Cary-630 spectrometer equipped with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory. The infrared spectra with 32 scans per sample (4000–400 cm− 1 at 4 cm− 1 resolution) were collected at room temperature."

The synthesis of MnFe2O4 nanocrystals, including those of approximately 150 nm in size, was achieved through a simple co-precipitation method as described in the article. The process began with the addition of a NaOH solution to a metal precursor solution of Mn2+ and Fe2+ ions at a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius. This resulted in the production of a green colored metal hydroxide, which subsequently transformed into dark-brown colored MnFe2O4 nanoparticles at 858C.

The analysis of the product was conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which revealed the formation of nanocrystals of nearly 100–200 nm in size (average 150 nm) having octahedron morphology. The high-resolution TEM image showed the lattice planes, which can be indexed to 220 having a distance of 0.29 nm.

The formation of nanooctahedra (NOh) was quite unexpected as it is typically difficult to control the size and morphology of nanomaterials without the use of a surface-directing agent or aggressive reaction conditions. However, the present method indicates that optimization of the reaction conditions during the synthesis can lead to morphology tuning. For the first time, it was observed that the addition of base to the metal precursor solution at 708C is crucial to tune the morphology to NOh.

The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the NOh can be indexed to the FCC structure of MnFe2O4 (JCPDS card no. 74-2403). The appearance of sharp and well-defined peaks indicates that the material is highly crystalline in nature. The FT-IR spectrum shows a band in the region of 400–500 cm1 corresponding to Mn-O and Fe-O stretching frequencies. The electron-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum shows peaks corresponding to Mn, Fe and O, confirming the purity of the material. The distribution of Mn, Fe and O in NOh can be visualized by X-ray mapping images of NOh. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of MnFe2O4 nanoparticles of approximately 150 nm in size can be achieved through a simple co-precipitation method involving the addition of a NaOH solution to a metal precursor solution of Mn2+ and Fe2+ ions at specific temperatures. The resulting product can be analyzed and confirmed using various methods such as SEM, TEM, XRD, FT-IR spectrum, and EDX spectrum."

The article does provide information on the synthesis of MnFe2O4 nanoparticles, although it does not specify the size of the nanoparticles produced. The MnFe2O4 nanozyme was prepared via a simple co-precipitation method. Specifically, 1 mM FeCl3 and 0.5 mM MnSO4 were first dissolved in 30 mL deionized water. Then the mixture was bubbled with pure N2 for 30 minutes to expel the dissolved O2. Afterwards, 20 mL NH3‧H2O was rapidly added to the mixture with a continuously vigorous stir. After reaction for 2 hours, the formed solids were rinsed with adequate deionized water until the leachate pH is nearly neutral. The products were collected via centrifugation and dried for use.

The synthesized material was characterized by several means. The XRD pattern of the collected products was presented. Three ambiguous peaks attributed to the (311), (400), and (440) planes of spinel MnFe2O4 (JCPDS No. 10-0319) are observed. These indefinable diffraction signals reveal that the MnFe2O4 material prepared by the co-precipitation method has a poor crystallinity, which is in accordance with the previous study. The HRTEM image does not provide long-range ordered crystal structures. Instead, only some short-range lattice fringes are observed in the HRTEM image. This result also supports the poor crystallinity of the synthesized MnFe2O4. As demonstrated by the full XPS, both Fe and Mn are present in the obtained material. In the Mn 2p XPS, the four fitting peaks centered at 654.7, 653.5, 643.8, and 642.3 eV are ascribed to Mn4+ 2p1/2, Mn2+ 2p1/2, Mn4+ 2p3/2, and Mn2+ 2p3/2, respectively. This result suggests the co-existence of Mn2+ and Mn4+ in the synthesized MnFe2O4. The Mn4+ species is supposed to originate from the redox reaction between the Mn2+ and Fe3+ precursors during synthesis."

The synthesis of AuPt nanostructures, including Au0.75Pt0.25 nanoparticles, is described in the article. The method involves co-reduction of Au3+ and Pt2+ in aqueous solutions. The composition of the nanoparticles can be easily tuned by adjusting the molar ratios of added Pt2+ to Au3+.

For Au0.75Pt0.25 nanoparticles, the Au/Pt molar ratio would be 3/1. A 40μl 0.1M AA (L-ascorbic acid) solution is then added into the homogenous solution and shaken vigorously. The solution is placed in a 30 °C water bath for 2 hours. The color of the solution becomes dark brown, suggesting the formation of AuPt bimetallic nanoparticles. 

Afterwards, 0.1 mL 0.1M CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) is added into the solutions. The same procedure is used to prepare pure Au and Pt nanoparticles except without the addition of either PtCl4 2− or AuCl4−. The samples are then purified by centrifugation at 12000 rounds per minute for 10 minutes and the precipitation is re-dispersed in water. 

The synthesized nanoparticles are named as AuxPt1-x alloy nanoparticles, where x represents the added Au/Pt ratio. In the case of Au0.75Pt0.25 nanoparticles, the Au/Pt ratio is 3/1. 

The article does not specify the size of the nanoparticles synthesized using this method. However, the size of nanoparticles can often be controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions, such as the concentration of the precursors, the reaction temperature, and the reaction time. 

The characterization of the nanoparticles is performed using a UV-VIS-NIR Spectrometer (Varian Cary 5000) and a matched quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. The crystal structures of the AuPt alloy nanoparticles are also studied."

The article provides a detailed method for the synthesis of AuPt nanostructures, including Au0.5Pt0.5 nanoparticles. The synthesis process involves co-reduction of Au3+ and Pt2+ in aqueous solutions. The composition of the resulting nanoparticles can be easily tuned by adjusting the molar ratios of added Pt2+ to Au3+. 

The specific chemicals used in the synthesis process include Chlorauric acid (HAuCl4∙3H2O), potassium tetrachloroplatinate (II) (K2PtCl4), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), hydrogen peroxide, and L-ascorbic acid (AA). The AuPt nanostructures were prepared by mixing desirable volumes of 17mM AuCl4− and 24mM PtCl42− in 2mL H2O (according to the calculated Au/Pt molar ratio in the bimetallic alloy from 3/1, 1/1, 1/1.5, 1/3, 1/6 to 1/10). A 40μl 0.1M AA solution (ratio of AA/(Au3+ +Pt2+)=10) was added into the homogenous solution and was shaken vigorously. The solution was placed in a 30 °C water bath for 2 hours. The color became dark brown which suggested the formation of AuPt bimetallic NPs. Then, 0.1 mL 0.1M CTAB was added into above solutions. 

The same procedure was used to prepare pure Au and Pt nanoparticles except without the addition of either PtCl42− or AuCl4−. The samples were purified by centrifugation at 12000 rounds per min for 10 min and the precipitation was re-dispersed in water. The AuxPt1-x alloy NPs were named as Au0.75Pt0.25, Au0.5Pt0.5, Au0.4Pt0.6, Au0.25Pt0.75, Au0.15Pt0.85 and Au0.09Pt0.91 alloy NPs, respectively, according to the added Au/Pt ratio.

The characterization of the AuPt alloy was done using a UV-VIS-NIR Spectrometer (Varian Cary 5000) and a matched quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. The crystal structures of the AuPt alloy were also studied. However, the article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 25 nm Au0.5Pt0.5 nanoparticles."

The synthesis of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) of approximately 1.7 nm in size was achieved through a one-pot reaction in an aqueous solution, utilizing Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as both a reductant and a stabilizer. This method is described as simple, green, and economical. The use of sodium borohydride, a common reducing agent that is harmful to organisms and the environment, was avoided. Additionally, PVP as a stabilizer is cheaper and more eco-friendly compared to other substances like polyamidoamine dendrimers, heparin, and mercaptans.

In a typical synthesis procedure, sodium acetate trihydrate was added into 40 mL of Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6⋅6H2O) solution (62 mg, 0.12 mmol) to adjust the pH value to 7.0. Then, 20 mL PVP solution (Mw = 30,000, 2.7 g) was added dropwise under vigorous stirring. After stirring for 2 hours, the obtained light yellow solution was immersed in an oil bath and heated to reflux for 4 hours at a temperature of 110 ◦C. The resulting black colloid was centrifuged using 15 mL ultracentrifugal filter devices (Millipore Amicon Ultra-15, 50 kDa) to remove the residual PVP and washed by ultrapure water several times. The concentration of the resulting PVP-stabilized Pt nanoclusters (PVP-Pt NCs) was adjusted to 1 mg/mL (counted as Pt content) for further use.

The PVP-Pt NCs were found to be monodisperse and mostly quasi-spherical, with no agglomeration observed. This was attributed to the steric hindrance effect of the PVP stabilizer on the surface of the Pt nanoclusters. The average size of the PVP-Pt NCs was approximately 1.7 nm, as determined by statistically analyzing more than 200 nanoparticles from Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image showed that the crystal lattice space of the PVP-Pt NCs was 0.224 nm, corresponding well to the (111) facet of metallic Pt.

The chemical states of the as-prepared PVP-Pt NCs were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The strong peaks of Pt 4f, C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s were clearly observed, with the C, O, and N elements mainly coming from PVP molecules. The peaks of binding energies at 70.7 and 74.1 eV corresponded to the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 of metallic species of Pt(0), respectively. The peaks at 71.7 and 76.1 eV could be ascribed to the oxidized species of Pt2+. No Pt4+ species were observed in the PVP-Pt NCs, indicating the complete reduction of H2PtCl6. The PVP-Pt NCs remained uniform and showed no apparent precipitate after six months of placement, suggesting good water solubility."

The synthesis of MnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with a size of around 4.5 nm was achieved using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a template. The process involved several steps and parameters, including the use of specific reagents, equipment, and conditions.

In a typical process, 25 mg BSA with 10 mL of 0.01 mol L1 PBS buffer was transferred into a 20 mL reaction flask, then 50 mL of 100 mmol L1 MnAc2 aqueous solution was added. The mixed solution of Mn2+–BSA emulsion was kept stirring for 2 min at room temperature, and then 50 mL of 1 mol L1 NaOH aqueous solution was added to the as-prepared solutions. After NaOH addition, the color of the solution immediately changed to an orange color. Finally, the BSA-MnO2 NPs were obtained after stirring for 6–8 h. The solution was then dialyzed in double distilled water for 48 h and centrifuged at 18 500 rpm for 30 min to remove unreacted MnAc2 and NaOH. The final solution was stored at 4 C in a refrigerator when not in use.

The biomineralization of MnO2 with BSA may be a multistep process involving Mn(II) binding, oxidation by oxygen, nucleation and crystal growth with uniform orientation. As shown in Fig. 1a, BSA provided amino acid residues for specific affinity with Mn(II). MnO2 was achieved by oxidation of Mn(II) in air, and the deposition/crystallization of MnO2 should occur selectively only on the specific sites of BSA. During the process, oxygen was important. When the reaction was bubbled with high purity nitrogen, no MnO2 NPs were formed, indicating that oxygen may participate in the reaction to form the Mn–O bond. The addition of NaOH was also necessary. No NPs were obtained without NaOH, indicating that pH is very important.

The UV-vis absorption spectrum was used to investigate the formation of MnO2 NPs. Firstly, as shown in Fig. S2a, ESI,† when the pH was greater than 11.62, the BSA-Mn2+ was mostly transformed into BSA-MnO2 NPs. Secondly, different reaction temperatures were investigated (Fig. S2b, ESI†). It was found that MnO2 NPs formed very quickly when the temperature was at the range from 20 C to 50 C; a higher temperature, however, could cause BSA inactivation. Thirdly, ionic strength was investigated using different concentrations of NaCl (Fig. S2c, ESI†), and 0.01 mol L1 ionic strength was best due to the solubility of BSA. Lastly, the molar ratio of BSA and Mn2+ precursor was critical for controlling the size of the NPs. As shown in Fig. S2d, ESI,† decreasing the concentration of BSA led to the sedimentation of the MnO2 NPs. Thus, the molar ratio of 3.7 : 100 for BSA and Mn2+ precursor, respectively, was used."

The synthesis of Au@PtAg nanostructures, which includes nanoparticles (NPs), is described in the article. The process involves two main steps: the synthesis of gold nanorods (NRs) and the synthesis of Au@PtAg nanostructures.

For the synthesis of gold nanorods, a seed-mediated method is used. CTAB-capped Au seeds are synthesized by the chemical reduction of HAuCl4 with NaBH4. Specifically, 7.5 mL of CTAB (0.1 M) aqueous solution is mixed with 100 mL of HAuCl4 (24 mM) and diluted with water to 9.4 mL. Then, 0.6 mL of ice-cold NaBH4 (0.01 M) is added with magnetic stirring. After 3 minutes, the stirring is stopped and the seed solution is kept undisturbed at 30 degrees Celsius for 2–5 hours. The seeds can be used within 2–5 hours after preparation. 

After that, the growth solution of the Au NRs is prepared, which consists of CTAB (0.1 M, 100 mL), HAuCl4 (25.5 mL, 1.96 mL), AgNO3 (0.01 M, 1.0 mL), H2SO4 (0.1 M, 2 mL), and AA (0.1 M, 0.8 mL). Then 240 mL of seed solution is added to the above growth solution to initiate the growth of the Au NRs. After 12 hours, the Au NRs are purified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The precipitate is collected and redispersed in deionized water. The volume used is 100 mL.

For the synthesis of Au@PtAg nanostructures, a PtCl4 22 aqueous solution (2 mM) is prepared as follows: 0.0688 g of K2PtCl4 is dissolved in 2 mL of 0.2 M aqueous HCl solution and then diluted to 100 mL with deionized water. 1 mL of the above Au NR solution is mixed with 23.5 mL of 2 mM PtCl4 22 solution. Then, 5 mL of AA (0.1 M) is added. The mixture is shaken vigorously and placed in a 30 degrees Celsius water bath. Within 5–6 hours, the color of the solution changes from pink-red to gray, suggesting the formation of the Pt shell. The calculated Pt/Au molar ratio is 0.1. The products are denoted as Au@Pt0.1 NRs.

For the synthesis of Au@PtAg nanostructures, the above solution (2 mL) is mixed with different volumes (0, 2, 2.67, 3.2, 4, 5.3, 8, 12, 24, 40 mL) of 10 mM AgNO3 and 40 mL of 2 mM PtCl4 22.

After 1 hour, 1 mL of 0.1 M CTAB is added to stabilize the Au@PtAg NRs. The products are purified by centrifugation (12,000 rpm for 10 minutes). The precipitate is then redispersed in deionized water.

The Au@PtAg nanostructures are then coated with PSS. 1.0 mL of Au@PtAg suspension is purified by centrifugation (12,000 rpm for 5 minutes). The precipitate is then redispersed in 1.0 mL of water and mixed with 50 mL of 20 mg mL21 PSS solution (containing 60 mM NaCl). The suspension is placed in a 30 degrees Celsius water bath for at least 3 hours. After that, centrifugation (12,000 rpm 5 minutes) is executed once to remove the excess PSS and the precipitate is redispersed in water or buffer solution for further use.

The synthesis of Au@PtAg nanostructures, including those with a Ag/Pt ratio of 0.33, involves several steps as described in the article. 

Firstly, gold nanorods (NRs) are synthesized via a seed-mediated method. CTAB-capped Au seeds are synthesized by the chemical reduction of HAuCl4 with NaBH4. Specifically, 7.5 mL of CTAB (0.1 M) aqueous solution is mixed with 100 mL of HAuCl4 (24 mM) and diluted with water to 9.4 mL. Then, 0.6 mL of ice-cold NaBH4 (0.01 M) is added with magnetic stirring. After 3 min, the stirring is stopped and the seed solution is kept undisturbed at 30 uC for 2–5 h. The seeds can be used within 2–5 h after preparation. 

After that, the growth solution of the Au NRs is prepared, which consists of CTAB (0.1 M, 100 mL), HAuCl4 (25.5 mL, 1.96 mL), AgNO3 (0.01 M, 1.0 mL), H2SO4 (0.1 M, 2 mL), and AA (0.1 M, 0.8 mL). Then 240 mL of seed solution is added to the above growth solution to initiate the growth of the Au NRs. After 12 h, the Au NRs are purified by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 10 min. The precipitate is collected and redispersed in deionized water. The volume used is 100 mL.

For the synthesis of Au@PtAg nanostructures, a PtCl4 22 aqueous solution (2 mM) is prepared as follows: 0.0688 g of K2PtCl4 is dissolved in 2 mL of 0.2 M aqueous HCl solution and then diluted to 100 mL with deionized water. 1 mL of the above Au NR solution is mixed with 23.5 mL of 2 mM PtCl4 22 solution. Then, 5 mL of AA (0.1 M) is added. The mixture is shaken vigorously and placed in a 30 uC water bath. Within 5–6 h, the color of the solution changes from pink-red to gray, suggesting the formation of the Pt shell. The calculated Pt/Au molar ratio is 0.1. The products are denoted as Au@Pt0.1 NRs.

The article does provide a detailed procedure for the synthesis of Au@PtAg nanostructures, although it does not specify the size of the nanoparticles produced. 

The synthesis of gold nanorods (NRs) is the first step. This is achieved via a seed-mediated method. CTAB-capped Au seeds are synthesized by the chemical reduction of HAuCl4 with NaBH4.

The article does not provide specific instructions for synthesizing 2000 nm Ag3PO4 nanoparticles. However, it does describe the process of creating Ag3PO4 nanoparticles of approximately 200 nm in size. 

The Ag3PO4 nanoparticles were fabricated by a facile coprecipitation method. The reagents used in this process were AgNO3, Na2HPO4·12H2O, and water. The article does not specify the exact quantities of these reagents used in the experiment. 

The process involved the reaction of free Ag+ ions in water, leading to the spontaneous and uncontrollable growth of Ag3PO4 crystals. The rapid nucleation and same growth rates of various planes of Ag3PO4 crystals resulted in an irregular spherical morphology. 

The characterization of the as-prepared photocatalysts was done using various instruments including X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IV), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100) equipped with the selected area electron diffraction (SAED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250), BET specific surface area (NOVA 4000e), and zeta potential (Zetasizer Nano-ZS).

The article does not provide specific instructions for adjusting the size of the nanoparticles to 2000 nm. However, it is generally understood in the field of nanoparticle synthesis that factors such as the concentration of the reagents, the temperature of the reaction, and the duration of the reaction can influence the size of the resulting nanoparticles."

The synthesis of Ch-PtNPs, or Chitosan-Platinum Nanoparticles, is described in the provided text. The TEM image in Fig. 1C revealed that Ch-PtNPs had good dispersity with an average particle diameter of 2.1±0.3 nm. This result could be well supported by the hydrodynamic diameter measurement (Fig. S2). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image indicated a continuous lattice spacing of 0.20 nm (Fig. 1C inset), which corresponds to the (200) planes of Pt. The significant Pt signals observed in the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum suggested that the nanoparticles incorporated into the Ch were Pt (Fig. S3).

The synthesis process is as follows: 2 mL of 10 mM H2PtCl6 was mixed with 47 mL of 0.2% Ch and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Then, 1 mL of a newly prepared solution of NaBH4 (0.2 M) was injected within 5 min and stirred for 90 min at room temperature. The as-synthesized Ch-PtNPs could be stored at 4 °C in the dark for at least one year with negligible changes in their colloidal stability and catalytic activity.

In the XPS results shown in Fig. 1D, the Pt 4f7/2 peak could be deconvoluted into two different components at binding energies of 72.38 and 72.91 eV, corresponding to Pt0 and Pt2+, respectively. The relative amounts of Pt0 and Pt2+ in the Ch-PtNPs were determined to be 55% and 45%, respectively. Remarkably, the oxidation state in the Ch-PtNPs was quite different from that of other previously reported PtNPs, which commonly consisted of Pt0 and Pt4+ species.

In conclusion, a simple, one-step approach for synthesizing PtNPs using Ch as the stabilizer and NaBH4 as the reducing agent was introduced. Interestingly, unlike some previously reported stabilizing molecules, Ch did not affect the catalytic active sites of PtNPs. Kinetic studies indicated that the Ch-PtNPs have a higher affinity for TMB than other types of oxidase mimics."

The article describes the synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) using a modified procedure. The specific size of the nanoparticles is not mentioned in the synthesis process, but the characterization of the nanoparticles indicates that they are spherical in shape with an average size of about 3−5 nm. 

For the synthesis, 4.5 mL of tetra-n-butyl titanate was added into 75 mL of distilled water dropwise and then the mixture was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. Subsequently, the solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated at 433 K for 24 hours. The acquired products were filtered and washed with distilled water several times and dried at 333 K for 12 hours.

The as obtained TiO2 NPs were redispersed in water by ultrasonication. TiO2−CA NPs were acquired by mixing 250 μL of catechol (CA, 1.0 × 10−4 mol/L) and 1 mL of TiO2 NPs solution (1.5 mg/mL) for a moment and then centrifuged and redispersed in 1 mL of ultrapure water.

The characterization of the nanoparticles was performed using a variety of techniques. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were performed using a JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were captured on a Hitachi S-4800 high-resolution scanning electron microscope. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern was obtained by an X’Pert Philips materials research diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation and employing a scanning speed of 0.02° s−1 in the 2θ range of 20 to 75°. Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet FT-IR 6700 spectrometer.

The article does not provide specific details on how to control the size of the nanoparticles during synthesis. However, it was found that the size of TiO2 NPs influenced the phototriggered oxidase-like activity of the formed TiO2−CA. As the size of TiO2 NPs decreases, the catalytic activity of the formed TiO2−CA increases. This can be explained that the surface sites available for the formation of the charge transfer complex decrease when the sizes of TiO2 NPs increase. The binding of enediol-ligands to TiO2 NPs occurs only with smaller particle sizes (D < 20 nm)."

The synthesis of yolk-shell Au@HCNs (Au nanoparticles encapsulated by hollow carbon nanospheres) is described in the article. Firstly, a wine-red solution of Au nanoparticles was prepared according to the previous literature. The exact concentration or mmols of the Au nanoparticles is not specified in the article. These Au nanoparticles were then capped with a SiO2 shell by tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) hydrolysis through the Stöber process, yielding Au@SiO2 nanospheres. 

Next, the Au@SiO2 nanospheres were impregnated with dopamine in Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5). After that, the Au@SiO2@polydopamine (PDA) nanocomposites were obtained by polymerization of dopamine molecules on the surface of Au@SiO2 slowly. The exact concentration or mmols of dopamine and Tris-HCl buffer used is not specified in the article.

Subsequently, the obtained Au@SiO2@PDA nanoparticles were carbonized in N2 at 800 °C for 2 hours. Finally, the silica core was etched with NaOH, giving rise to a yolk-shell structure of Au particles encapsulated by hollow carbon nanospheres, abbreviated as Au@HCNs. The exact concentration or mmols of NaOH used is not specified in the article.

It is worth emphasizing that the dopamine used in the experiments provides a nitrogen source, and the nitrogen atoms incorporated in the carbon shell are considered to be an effective method to regulate the properties of carbon, which expands the potential applications of the carbon materials. For purposes of comparison, N-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (HCNs) were also synthesized as the control group.

The successful encapsulation of Au in the hollow carbon spheres was further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image demonstrates that the diameter of Au nanoparticle was about ~ 10 nm and the carbon shell thickness was 6 ~ 7 nm. The lattice spacings of Au nanoparticles were 0.235 nm and 0.204 nm, which were consistent with Au (111) and Au (200) planes, respectively. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) line scan of Au@HCNs suggested that the shell mainly contained C and N, and the dark nanoparticle inside the shell was Au."

After centrifugation, the solid was washed with water, dried at 50 °C overnight under vacuum, and then calcined at 450 °C for 4 h in air.

The Co3O4 nanocubes were synthesized by dissolving 0.50 g of Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O in the solution of 10 mL of water and 15 mL of ethanol. Under vigorous stirring, 2.5 mL of 25% ammonia was added drop by drop to the above solution. The solution was stirred for about 15 min in air, and the solution was transferred into an autoclave with 48 mL volume, sealed, and heated to 150 °C for 3 h. Then, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally. The black products were obtained by centrifugation, washed with water several times, and dried at 60 °C overnight under vacuum.

The synthesis of platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) of approximately 1 nm in size was achieved using apoferritin (apoFt) as a nanoreactor. The process began with a solution of apoFt (1 mM, 2.5 mL) mixed with K2PtCl4 (24 mM, 126 mL). To increase the electrostatic interaction between Pt ions and the interior surface of apoFt, the solution was adjusted to pH 8.5 using 0.2 M NaOH, followed by stirring for 2 hours at room temperature. 

After this, a solution of NaBH4 (0.2 M, 150 mL) was added to the mixture and stirred for 3 hours at room temperature. This reduction process resulted in the formation of zero-valent Pt NPs. The color of the solution changed to dark brown, with the intensity varying depending on the amount of Pt ions used. The absorption spectra also changed during reduction. The initial protein solution showed one peak at 280 nm; two small absorption peaks appeared at 305 and 380 nm after mixing with Pt ions. Finally, the two small peaks were replaced with a broad absorption spectrum, which is typical for Pt colloids after reduction reactions.

To avoid any by-product, the PteFt composite was purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S-300), using deionized water as elution buffer, and the first peak was collected at 280 nm monitored by Ultraviolet Detector. The TEM images showed that the Pt NPs were largely monodispersed and roughly spherical. The Pt NPs have an average diameter of 1.87 ± 0.40 nm as shown in the histogram.

In the absence of apoFt, a black amorphous precipitate was observed. In contrast, the PteFt preparation remained a clear, dark brown solution for weeks at room temperature. High-resolution TEM images indicated a continuous lattice spacing of 0.224 nm, which corresponds to the (111) facet of an fcc Pt crystal. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopies (EDX) confirmed that it was Pt, but not iron in the protein cage. These results suggest the specific formation of Pt NPs inside the apoFt nanocage. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of Pt NPs of approximately 1 nm in size was achieved using a solution of apoFt and K2PtCl4, adjusted to pH 8.5 and reduced with NaBH4. The resulting PteFt composite was purified by size-exclusion chromatography and confirmed to contain Pt NPs through TEM imaging and EDX spectroscopy."

The synthesis of RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with an average diameter of 4.0 nm was described in the article. The process was carried out using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope operated at 200 kV for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments. The kinetics of the catalytic processes were investigated by UV–visible spectrophotometry on a V-570 UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer (JASCO Corp., Japan). Electrochemical experiments were carried out using a CH Instruments model 660 A electrochemical workstation.

The synthesis process was as follows: RuCl3 (0.10 g) was dissolved into methanol (25 mL). The solution was stirred magnetically and heated to 50 8C. An aliquot (10 mL) of NaOH (0.50m) in methanol was added dropwise. After the addition of water (25 mL), the reaction mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (200 mL) and annealed at 150–1908C for 10–12 h. 

The RuO2 NPs were collected and purified by multiple centrifugation/decantation/dispersion cycles with methanol, and were dried, overnight, at 100 8C in vacuum. Energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray photon spectroscopic analyses indicated that the NPs are essentially pure RuO2. 

Bioconjugation was done by first coating the RuO2 NPs with 2,2’-bipyridine-4,4’-dicarboxylic acid. Amine-terminated oligonucleotide DPs were then coupled to the carboxyl groups through 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide chemistry.

The synthesis of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) with an average diameter of 164.8 ± 20.7 nm was achieved through a solvothermal method. The morphology of the NPs was precisely regulated by varying the pH of the precursor solution. To enhance the biocompatibility and aqueous stability, PEGylation was concurrently realized upon the addition of NH2−PEG3400-COOH as a surfactant additive.

The specific procedure for the synthesis of the CoFe2O4 NPs involved the following steps: FeCl3·6H2O and CoCl2·6H2O were dissolved in ethylene glycol, and NaAc was then added to the solution. Subsequently, NaOH was added dropwise to the previous system until a pH value of 12 was obtained. The mixture was transferred into a tetrafluoroethylene vessel, which was sealed in a stainless-steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated at a rate of 2 °C/min and maintained at 200 °C for 6 hours. The product of CoFe2O4 was magnetically isolated, followed by being washed twice with absolute ethyl alcohol and thrice with DI water.

To conjugate PEG, the CoFe2O4 NPs were mixed with NH2−PEG3400-COOH (32 μg/mL, 1:1 by weight), and the reaction proceeded under stirring at 25 °C for 24 hours. Finally, the CoFe2O4 NPs were magnetically separated and thoroughly washed with DI water prior to any use.

The synthesized CoFe2O4 NPs exhibited a well-defined flower-like structure with a narrow size distribution. The large surface area of the NPs would provide more active sites for catalytic reactions. Moreover, these NPs displayed admirably high dispersity without significant aggregation. The hydrated size of the NPs was determined to be ∼280.1 nm through dynamic light scattering (DLS), and the slightly enlarged size under aqueous condition was within the effective range of enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) taking effect. The crystal structure of the NPs matched that of pristine CoFe2O4 from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, indicating a high crystalline purity of the NPs but with a bit of crystalline cobalt impurity doping. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed to testify the effective conjugation of PEG onto CoFe2O4."

The synthesis of Eu2O2S nanoparticles was carried out using a solvothermal route. The solvent used was a long chain primary amine, oleylamine, which also acted as a strong electron donor at elevated temperature and as a surfactant in the nanoparticle synthesis. The precursor complex [(Et3NH)]+[Eu(acda)4] was obtained by reacting one equivalent of europium(III) nitrate with four equivalents each of 2-aminocyclopentene-1-dithiocarboxylic acid (Hacda) and triethylamine. 

The synthesis was carried out in an open atmosphere. The FT-IR spectra obtained for the three types of nanoparticle in the range of 4000–400 cm1 clearly revealed the absence of any adsorbed organic materials. All the syntheses were carried out in an open atmosphere. 

Different structure-modifying capping agents were used at an elevated temperature to control the shape and size of the nanoparticles. When oleic acid and octadecene were introduced into the system as the surfactant along with oleylamine, the material crystallized in the form of ultra-thin 3D hexagonal nanoplates with a surface diameter of 8–12 nm and thickness of 0.3 nm. 

On the other hand, when the surfactant oleic acid and 1-octadecene were replaced by trioctylphosphine, this resulted in a notable change in shape resulting in nanosphere formation. The average spherical diameter of the particles was about 13 (2.5) nm. 

When the choice of both reacting amine and surfactant is constrained to oleylamine, the outcome is the formation of short rod-like particles of dimensions of 3.0 (1) nm x 7.0 (1) nm in addition to the formation of smaller nanocrystals.

The FT-IR spectra obtained for the three types of nanoparticle in the range of 4000–400 cm1 clearly revealed the absence of any adsorbed organic materials.

When oleic acid and octadecene were introduced into the system as the surfactant along with oleylamine, the material crystallized in the form of ultra-thin 3D hexagonal nanoplates with a surface diameter of 8–12 nm and thickness of 0.3 nm. It has been reported that alkylamines show weaker binding capacity to metal centers on the surface of the nanoparticles compared to that of carboxylic acids of similar chain length. Therefore, it has been anticipated that more strongly adsorbed oleic acid leads to surface stabilization and the formation of hexagonal nanoplates.

On the other hand, when the surfactant oleic acid and 1-octadecene were replaced by trioctylphosphine, this resulted in a notable change in shape resulting in nanosphere formation. When trioctylphosphine is rapidly injected into the reaction vessel, it readily binds to the surface of growing nanoparticles more effectively than oleylamine and rejects the chance of preferential growth in a favored direction by reducing surface energy. The nanoparticles with their surfaces protected by this phosphine ligand easily also discourages agglomeration. The average spherical diameter of the particles is about 13 (2.5) nm.

When the choice of both reacting amine and surfactant is constrained to oleylamine, the outcome is the formation of short rod-like particles of dimensions of 3.0 (1) nm x 7.0 (1) nm in addition to the formation of smaller nanocrystals. These irregular shape distribution and significantly low particle size are perhaps due to the weaker binding capacity of oleylamine to the metal surface by the non covalent interaction, preventing aggregation."

The synthesis of Eu2O2S nanoparticles (NPs) of approximately 13 nm in size is described in the provided article. The process involves solvothermal decomposition of a precursor complex, followed by the use of various surfactants to modulate the shape and size of the nanoparticles.

The precursor complex used in the synthesis is [NHEt3]+[Eu(acda)4], where acda is the anion of 2-aminocyclopentene-1-dithiocarboxylic acid. This complex is prepared by mixing Eu(NO3)35H2O and Hacda in methanol, followed by the slow addition of a methanol solution of triethylamine. The resulting deep orange microcrystalline solid is then filtered and washed with cold methanol.

For the synthesis of Eu2O2S nanoplates, a mixture of oleylamine, oleic acid, and octadecene is stirred and heated to 80 1C until a clear orange colored solution is formed. The precursor complex is then added and the mixture is heated to 280 1C for 1 hour. After cooling to room temperature, dry ethanol is slowly added to precipitate the light yellow product. The solid is then dispersed in toluene and reprecipitated with ethanol. This process is repeated four times to ensure the product is free from reactants.

To synthesize Eu2O2S nanospheres, oleylamine is first heated to 280 1C. A homogeneous suspension of the precursor complex in trioctylphosphine is then rapidly injected into the vigorously stirred oleylamine. After 1 hour, the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and dry ethanol is added to deposit a creamy product. This product is then centrifuged, dispersed in toluene, and reprecipitated with ethanol, repeating the process as described for the nanoplates.

For the synthesis of Eu2O2S rod-like particles, oleylamine is used both as the solvent and stabilizer. The precursor complex is suspended in oleylamine and heated at 120 1C for 20 minutes to form a clear solution. The temperature of the solution is then rapidly increased to 280 1C and maintained for 1 hour. After cooling to room temperature, the product is isolated in the same way as described for nanoplates.

The precursor complex [NHEt3]+[Eu(acda)4] is used for the synthesis, where acda is the anion of 2-aminocyclopentene-1-dithiocarboxylic acid. The precursor complex is synthesized by mixing [Eu(NO3)35H2O] (0.86 g, 2 mmol) in 5 mL methanol and Hacda (1.26 g, 8 mmol) in 20 mL methanol. Subsequently, a methanol solution of triethylamine (0.81 g, 8 mmol) is slowly added with stirring to the above solution. A deep orange microcrystalline solid begins to deposit almost immediately. The product is filtered and washed with cold methanol after 0.5 h of stirring.

For the synthesis of Eu2O2S nanoplates, a stirred mixture of oleylamine (6 mL), oleic acid (2 mL), octadecene (2 mL), and 0.4 g of the precursor complex are used. The temperature of the mixture is maintained at 80 1C until a clear orange colored solution is formed. It is then heated to 280 1C for 1 h, during which the color of the solution fades to become a pale yellow colloid. After cooling to room temperature, dry ethanol is slowly added with stirring to precipitate the light yellow product, which is obtained by centrifugation (20 min at 9000 rpm). The solid is dispersed in toluene and reprecipitated again with ethanol. The process is repeated four times to make the product free from reactants. It is then dried in vacuum.

The synthesis of porous ruthenium selenide nanoparticles (P-RuSe2) was carried out using KIT-6 silica templates. The chemicals and materials used for the synthesis included RuCl3·xH2O, selenium powder, ethanol, n-butanol, hydrofluoric acid (40%), hydrochloric acid (37%), o-phenylenediamine (OPD), and polyethylene oxide–polypropylene oxide–polyethylene (PEO-PPO-PEO), all of which were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Hydrogen peroxide (30%), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (TMB) were obtained from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemical reagents were utilized as received without any further purification. All aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized water (18.2 MΩ•cm, Millipore).

The synthesis of P-RuSe2 involved several steps. First, 1 g of RuCl3·xH2O was dissolved into 10 mL of ethanol. Then, 1 g of calcined KIT-6 template was added into RuCl3 solution under stirring. The temperature of the solution was raised to 60 °C and stirred until ethanol evaporated. After loading into KIT-6 templates, the RuCl3 salt was placed in one crucible, and 0.5 g selenium powder was placed in another crucible. These two crucibles were loaded into a quartz tube furnace, where the selenium powder was placed upstream. Then, the sample was heated to 550 °C at a ramp rate of 2 °C/min and maintained at 550 °C for 2 h under a forming gas of 10% H2 in argon. Finally, P-RuSe2 was obtained by removing KIT-6 silica templates with HF solution (1 M).

The characterization of P-RuSe2 was carried out using various instruments. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Zeiss Ultra55 microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected on a JEM-200CX microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data was obtained on a Rigaku Ultima diffractometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data was collected on a PHI 5000 VersaProbe electron spectrometer. UV–visible absorption spectra were recorded with a TU-1900 spectrophotometer. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm was measured using a Quantachrome Autosorb-IQ-2C-TCD-VP analyzer, and the surface area and pore size were calculated with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and the Barrett–Joyner-Halenda model, respectively.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 15000 nm YVO4 nanoparticles. However, it does detail the preparation of YVO4 flower-like microstructures via a hydrothermal process. 

In this process, 1.0 mmol of NH4VO3 and 1.0 mmol of Y(NO3)3⋅6H2O were dissolved in 30 mL of Milli-Q water under continuous stirring to form solution A and B, respectively. Then solution B was slowly added into solution A with continuous stirring to obtain a suspension. After adjusting the pH of suspension to 1 and 10 min stirring, the suspension would be transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. Subsequently, the autoclave was sealed and maintained in an air dry oven at 180 ℃ for 24 h, which was naturally cooled to room temperature after the hydrothermal process. Afterwards, yellow precipitates would be gathered by filtration, successively washing by Milli-Q water and ethanol many times, and drying at 60 ◦C in air for 8 h. At last, YVO4 flower-like microstructures were obtained and denoted as YVFPs.

The crystal structure, morphology, chemical compositions and surface properties of YVO4 materials were analyzed by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), automatic nitrogen adsorption specific surface and pore size distribution analyzer, and zeta potential measuring instrument.

However, the specific size of the synthesized YVO4 structures is not mentioned in the article. The article only mentions that YVO4 presented a flower-like structure with a size of approximately 15 µm, which was assembled by many quadrangular prisms with a length of about 7 µm.

In a typical synthesis procedure, sodium citrate solution (5.0 mL, 8 mM) was added to CuCl2 solution (5.0 mL, 8.0 mM), which was stirred for 5 minutes. Then, Na2S solution (5.0 mL, 16.0 mM) was dropwise syringed into the above solution under vigorous stirring for 15 minutes at 37 ◦C. Afterwards, BSA solution (5.0 mL, 50 mg mL− 1) was added to the above mixture solution and incubated at 37 ◦C for 8 hours. Finally, the solution was dialyzed against water for 24 hours. The thus-yielded CuS was stored in darkness at 4 ◦C. 

The obtained nanoparticles were water-soluble, which were uniformly dispersed from Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images with the size of 6.0 ± 0.4 nm, typical of nanoclusters. The TEM images were observed on an F20 S-TWIN instrument (FEI, USA). 

The chemicals and materials used in the synthesis included Bovine serum albumin (BSA), O-phenylenediamine (OPDA), copper chloride (CuCl2), trisodium citrate dihydrate and sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S⋅9H2O) which were bought from J&K Scientific Ltd. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of CuS NCs involves the use of BSA as a template, sodium citrate, CuCl2, and Na2S as reagents, and a series of steps including stirring, incubation, and dialysis. The process is carried out under mild conditions in an aqueous solution at room temperature, and the resulting CuS NCs are water-soluble and uniformly dispersed with a size of 6.0 ± 0.4 nm."

The synthesis of ZnS nanoparticles (NPs) is described in the provided text. The preparation of ZnS NPs involves the use of ionogels as precursors. In PPCT-Zn2+ ionogels, the Zn2+ is fixed at the fibrillar framework, which can be used as a precursor to prepare uniformly distributed zinc-based materials. The detailed preparation of ZnS nanomaterials using PPCT-Zn2+ ionogels as precursors is shown in the Supporting Information. The PPCT/Zn2+ ionogels are viscoelastic soft quasi-solid materials. 

The synthesis process involves the gradual release of Zn2+ from the ionogels by introducing NaHS into the ionogels, and ZnS precipitates are obtained. The XRD pattern of the obtained products indicates an fcc symmetry, which is in good agreement with the ICPDS files of ZnS (JCPDS NO. 65-5476). The crystal structure is refined to the F 4 3 space group with the lattice parameters of a = b = c = 5.404 Å. 

The TEM images reveal that the as-prepared ZnS NPs have a homogenous size distribution with an average diameter of about 10 nm. The N2 adsorption/desorption analysis of ZnS was performed, as shown in Figure 8e. The N2 sorption isotherm shows an obvious hysteresis loop in the range of P/P0 = 0.8 - 1.0 that can be classified as type (III), which confirms the formation of porous materials. 

For the preparation of ZnS Nanoparticles (NPs), Na2S, NaHS or TAA solution was added to the ionogels (30 mmol∙L−1 PPCT/60 mmol∙L−1 ZnCl2, 8 mL) to make the molar ratio of Zn2+ to S2- of 1:1. The deposition reactions occurred in the mixtures. After the reaction was completed, the ionogels were destroyed and the products at the bottom of the tube were collected by centrifugation and washed several times with alcohol and deionized water.

The specific BET surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) adsorption pore volume were determined to be 102.25 m2∙g−1 and 0.54 cm3∙g−1, respectively, which are larger than those of other ZnS nanomaterials. The pore size has a uniform distribution of around 4.0 nm. The high surface areas and uniform pore sizes of ZnS provide a feasible environment to tolerate expansion and shrinkage that are caused by the adsorption of small molecules; thus, this material is a candidate catalyst to catalyze reactions."

The high surface areas and uniform pore sizes of ZnS provide a feasible environment to tolerate expansion and shrinkage that are caused by the adsorption of small molecules; thus, this material is a candidate catalyst to catalyze reactions. The obtained ZnS has an ideal architecture and can be used as a catalyst to catalyze chemical reactions. The catalytic oxidation of peroxidase substrate, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethlbenzidine (TMB), in the presence of H2O2 was examined to evaluate the catalytic efficiency of ZnS NPs. The TMB-oxidized product can be traced by its maximum absorbance at 652 nm."

The synthesis of FeS2 nanoparticles (NPs) of about 200 nm in diameter was accomplished by the straightforward sulfidation of Fe3O4 NPs. The precursor Fe3O4 NPs were prepared according to previous literature. In a typical process, FeCl3⋅6H2O (2.432 g, 9 mmol) and trisodium citrate (0.774 g, 3 mmol) were dissolved in ethylene glycol (60 mL) by stirring for 1 h. After that, sodium acetate (3.6 g, 43.9 mmol) was added to the mixture, which was continuously stirred for another 1 h. After ultrasonication for 0.5 h, the solution was sealed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 200 �C for 10 h. 

After cooling to room temperature, the black Fe3O4 NPs were obtained by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 10 min) and washing with distilled water/ethanol (1:1, v/v) for three times. Subsequently, the mixture containing Fe3O4 NPs and excess sulfur powder was loaded in the quartz boat covered by aluminum foil and heated at 400 �C for 5 h with a ramp of 2 �C min￾ 1 under the atmosphere of argon to get the final product of FeS2 NPs. 

The XRD pattern and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image confirm that Fe3O4 NPs with a diameter of about 170 nm have been successfully prepared. After sulfidation, the precursor Fe3O4 NPs were completely converted into FeS2 NPs (JCPDS card No. 71-1680), confirmed by the XRD analysis. TEM image shows that FeS2 NPs have successfully inherited the uniform morphology of Fe3O4 NPs with diameters of about 200 nm. The slight increased diameter compared to that of Fe3O4 NPs can be ascribed to the injection of sulfur element. The chemical state and composition shown in XPS survey spectrum further demonstrated the successful synthesis of FeS2 NPs."

In order to evaluate the feasibility of employing FeS2 NPs as enzyme mimics, the cytotoxicity of FeS2 NPs was evaluated by using HeLa cells. The viability of HeLa cells could remain above 96.8% even with the presence of 5 mg L￾ 1 FeS2 NPs. The low cytotoxicity of FeS2 NPs would pave the way for their subsequent application in the field of biosensing."

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Rigaku D/Max-rB X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 20 Ma, 2θ = 10–80° with a step size of 0.02°). This was used to confirm the phase of the as-synthesized CeCoO3 and PDI-CeCoO3. 

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) patterns were collected by a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi Multifunctional imaging electron spectrometer with Al Kα radiation operated at 250 W. This was used to clarify the surface composition of the PDI-CeCoO3 and the relationship between chemical components.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 2500 nm Co3V2O8 nanoparticles. The synthesis process described in the article is for Co-V MMOs (Mixed Metal Oxides) with different Co/V molar ratios, which are composite of Co3O4 and Co3V2O8. The size of the nanoparticles is not specified in the article.

The synthesis process begins with a strong agitation of water for 20 minutes. The mixed solution is then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, heated at 120 °C for 18 hours, and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The Co-V precursor precipitate with a Co/V molar ratio of 3:1 is centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol for at least three times separately, and dried at 60 °C for 12 hours. Precursors with Co/V molar ratios of 2:1 and 4:1 are synthesized using the same procedure. Precursors with different Co/V molar ratios are denoted as 2CoV, 3CoV, and 4CoV, respectively. 

The precursors are then calcined at 300, 400, 500, 600, and 800 °C in air for 2 hours with a heating rate of 5 °C/min, followed by a natural cooling process to room temperature. Finally, Co-V MMOs are formed and denoted as nCoV-300, nCoV-400, nCoV-500, nCoV-600, and nCoV-800 (n=2, 3, and 4), respectively. 

The crystalline structures of the as-prepared samples are evaluated by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analysis on a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15418 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA with the 2θ ranging from 5° to 80°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is recorded using a FEI Quanta FEG 250 scanning electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) are examined to analyze the morphological features using a JEM-2100 transmittance electron microscopy. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) is following on image captured. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG-DTA) is taken on a Mettler-Toledo TGA/DSC/1600HT instrument from room temperature to 900 °C at the heating rate of 5 °C/min. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) characterization is performed on a Nicolet iS10 FTIR spectrometer.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 4000 nm or other size Co3O4@NiO nanoparticles (NPs). However, it does detail the process of creating hierarchical Co3O4@NiO core-shell nanotubes, which may be similar. 

The Co-C composite nanofibers used in this work were prepared via a typical electrospinning method. In a typical procedure, 0.30 g of PAN and 5.25 g (0.072 mol) of DMF were mixed in a conical flask followed by vigorous stirring for 2 h at 80 ºC to make PAN completely dissolved. When the solution cooled down to the room temperature, 0.45 g (1.8 mmol) of Co(Ac)2·4H2O was put into the above solution, then the solution was stirred overnight to obtain a homogeneous deep purple solution. After that, the obtained homogeneous solution was used as precursor for electrospinning. During the electrospinning process, a high voltage of 17 kV was applied between the needle and collected aluminum foil with a distance of 20 cm. The obtained nanofiber mat was then peeled off from the collector and transferred to a tube furnace for calcination. It was first calcined at 225 ºC in an air atmosphere for 3 h, subsequently, in Ar atmosphere at 650 ºC for 2 h. The as-prepared Co-C nanofibers were collected for further experiments.

The Co-C composite nanofibers coated with NiO nanosheets were prepared via a facile deposition method. Typically, 2 mg of the obtained Co-C composite nanofibers were dispersed in 2 mL of water in a round-bottom flask under ultrasonic condition, and then a mixture containing 2 mL of water, 36.4 mg (0.125 mmol) of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.3 g (5 mmol) of urea was injected into the flask under ultrasonic. The solution was further heated at 80 ºC for 1 h in an oil bath under vigorous stirring. In the following, the solution was cooled down to room temperature naturally, and aged for another 7 h. The Co-C@NiO core-shell nanofibers were collected by magnetic separation and washed with water for several times until the supernatant was clear. Finally, the precipitate was freeze-dried overnight and then calcined in air at 500 ºC for 2 h to obtain hierarchical Co3O4@NiO core-shell nanotubes.

The XPS measurement was used to make further analysis of the as-prepared hierarchical Co3O4@NiO core-shell nanotubes on their surface chemistry (surface elemental compositions and oxidation states). As shown in Fig. 4a, typical signals of Co, Ni and O were clearly detected in full-scan spectrum of the product, indicating the formation of hierarchical Co3O4@NiO core-shell nanotubes.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 10000 nm Mo0.02-Co3O4 nanoparticles. However, it does detail the preparation of Mo-Co3O4 nanotubes via an electrospinning method combined with a calcination process. 

In the procedure, 0.63 g of PVP, 0.383 g of Co(NO3)2•6H2O and different molar fractions of molybdenyl acetylacetonate (0, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0%) were put into a conical flask, which contains 3.5 mL of ethanol and 3.5 mL of DMF. The mixture was vigorously stirred until a homogeneous and pink solution was formed. The molar fraction of molybdenyl acetylacetonate, or rather the doping ratio of Mo was calculated in accordance with a specific equation.

The precursors were then transferred into a glass capillary connecting to a high-voltage power supply with a setting voltage of 18 kV for electrospinning. An aluminum foil with a distance to the spinneret of around 20 cm was used as a collector to collect PVP/Co(NO3)2/molybdenyl acetylacetonate nanofibers. After the electrospinning, the flexible fibrous membrane was separated from the collector and transferred to a muffle furnace. The calcining course was conducted at 150 °C in air for 1 h with a heating speed at 1 °C min-1 to volatilize the water and solvent, followed by a calcination course at 550 °C in air for another 2 h with a heating speed at 2 °C min-1. Finally, the Mo-Co3O4 nanotubes with varied doping ratios of Mo6+ were prepared.

The morphologies of the as-prepared samples were characterized via a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI Nova NanoSEM) manipulated at 15 kV and a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-1200 EX) manipulated at 100 kV. A FEI Tecnai G2 F20 high-resolution transmission electron microscope was applied to provide typical high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The crystallographic structure of the samples was investigated via a XRD (PAN-alytical B.V. Empyrean) with CuKα radiation. XPS (Thermo Scientific ESCALAB250) measurement was applied to characterize the chemical composition of the Mo-Co3O4 nanotubes.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 10000 nm or other size Mo0.02-Co3O4 nanoparticles. The article discusses the synthesis of Mo-Co3O4 nanotubes via an electrospinning method combined with a calcination process, but it does not specify the size of the nanoparticles or the exact molar ratio of Mo to Co3O4.

In the procedure described, 0.63 g of PVP, 0.383 g of Co(NO3)2•6H2O and different molar fractions of molybdenyl acetylacetonate (0, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0%) were put into a conical flask, which contains 3.5 mL of ethanol and 3.5 mL of DMF. The mixture was vigorously stirred until a homogeneous and pink solution was formed. The molar fraction of molybdenyl acetylacetonate, or rather the doping ratio of Mo was calculated in accordance with a certain equation.

The precursors were then transferred into a glass capillary connecting to a high-voltage power supply with a setting voltage of 18 kV for electrospinning.

The article describes the synthesis of sheet-like FeS nanostructures, not specifically 50 nm FeS nanoparticles. However, the process could potentially be adapted to create nanoparticles of different sizes. The synthesis of the FeS nanostructure was achieved using a micelle-assisted synthetic method. 

The phase characterization was performed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a D/Max-RA diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation. The morphology and particle sizes of the samples were characterized by JEM-200CX transmission electron microscopy (TEM) working at 200 kV and LEO1530 VP field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) at an acceleration of 15 kV. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was performed on the FESEM with a PV9100 scanning electron microanalyzer. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were obtained using an ASAP 2000 instrument (Micromeritics. Norcross, GA). Before adsorption measurements, the samples were degassed for 2 h at 150 8C.

The catalytic experiments of the sheet-like FeS to the oxidation of TMB were carried out in a 1.5 mL tube with 10 mg sheet-like FeS or 1.0 ng HRP in 500 mL of 0.1m PBS (pH 7.0) in the presence of H2O2, using TMB as the substrate. Hitachi UV 2010 spectrophotometer was used to measure the apparent Michaelis–Menten constant (Kapp m ) of the sheet-like FeS.

Cyclic voltammetric and amperometric measurements were performed on CHI 660 (CHI, USA). A three-electrode system comprising a platinum wire as auxiliary, a saturated calomel electrode as reference and the FeS-modified electrode as working electrodes was used for all electrochemical experiments. The electrochemical experiments were carried out in a cell containing 5.0 mL 0.1m PBS at room temperature (2628C). All experimental solutions were deoxygenated by bubbling highly pure nitrogen for at least 10 min and maintained under nitrogen atmosphere during the measurements.

In the absence of DAHCl, the precipitation reaction of Fe2+ ions with S2 ions produced irregular particles. In presence of 0.02m DAHCl, this reaction formed regular spherical particles with a diameter of about 50 nm. With the increasing concentration of DAHCl, some sheet-like particles could be observed in the product. At the DAHCl concentration of 0.06m, the product contained about 60% spherical FeS and 40% sheet-like FeS particles. When its concentration was increased to 0.14m, sheet-like FeS with yield of at least 95% was obtained. Thus it can be concluded that the DAHCl plays an important role in the formation of the sheet-like nanostructure."

The article describes the synthesis of sheet-like FeS nanostructures using a micelle-assisted method. However, it does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 50 nm FeS nanoparticles. 

The synthesis of the sheet-like FeS nanostructure was carried out under N2 atmosphere. The article mentions the use of dodecanamine hydrochloride (DAHCl), a water-soluble compound, as a directing agent to prepare the FeS nanostructure. In the absence of DAHCl, the precipitation reaction of Fe2+ ions with S2 ions produced irregular particles. In the presence of 0.02m DAHCl, this reaction formed regular spherical particles with a diameter of about 50 nm.

Thus it can be concluded that the DAHCl plays an important role in the formation of the sheet-like nanostructure.

The characterization of the nanostructured FeS was performed using various techniques.

In amperometric experiments, the current–time data were recorded after a constant residual current had been established and successive additions of H2O2 solution into the buffer were done. It was carried out by applying a potential of 0.4 V on a stirred cell at room temperature. The sensor response was measured as the difference between total and residual currents."

The article describes a simple one-step reduction protocol for the synthesis of Fe–Co alloy nanoparticles (NPs). This process involves the use of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as a reducing agent. The synthesis is carried out in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) which acts as a stabilizing reagent. The reaction is performed in a one-pot setup.

The Fe–Co NPs are prepared by reducing iron(II) chloride (FeCl2) and cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl2) with NaBH4. The molar ratio of Fe to Co in the starting materials determines the composition of the resulting alloy nanoparticles. For instance, to prepare Fe0.5Co0.5 NPs, equal molar amounts of FeCl2 and CoCl2 are used.

The resulting nanoparticles are spherical with an average diameter of about 12.8 nm, as indicated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) data confirm the average elemental composition of the alloy, and the molar ratio of Fe and Co extremely agrees with the original proportion, suggesting the formation of the Fe–Co alloy nanostructure.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study showed two peaks with binding energy of 778.0 eV and 781.0 eV for the Co2p3/2 level in Co NPs and Fe0.5Co0.5 NPs, indicating that both elemental and oxidized Co coexist on the surface of Fe0.5Co0.5 NPs. Two peaks of Fe2p3/2 located at 706.8 and 711.1 eV indicate that Fe exists in both the oxidized and elemental states.

The article does not provide specific details on the quantities of the reagents used or the exact conditions (such as temperature and reaction time) under which the synthesis is performed. However, it is clear that the synthesis of Fe–Co alloy nanoparticles involves a simple one-step reduction process using readily available reagents and equipment."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) of a particular size such as 10 nm. However, it does mention that the ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles were prepared via an aqueous co-precipitation route, which is known as a low-cost and less time-consuming method for the synthesis of water-dispersible nanoferrites in high yields, especially for industrial scales. This method is also noted for being eco-friendly as it does not require any surfactant, hazardous solvents, high reaction temperature, or pressure.

The spinel ferrite nanoparticles, including ZnFe2O4, were characterized by various techniques such as XRD, SEM, TEM, SEM–EDX, and FT–IR spectroscopy. The XRD patterns for all the MFe2O4 samples, including ZnFe2O4, mostly correspond to the standard card of ferrites. The diffraction patterns of the characteristic peaks are in good agreement with data presented previously, indicating that the substitution of Fe2+ ion in ferrite by the divalent transition metal ions (Co2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Zn2+) does not alter the lattice of spinel ferrites.

SEM images of MFe2O4 nanoparticles show that the nanoparticles are of nano-dimensions in the size range of 20–40 nm and have an almost spherical shape. The morphology and particle size of the nano-ferrite samples were also investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The average particle sizes estimated from the TEM images were about 18, 15, 35, and 10 nm for MnFe2O4, CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, and ZnFe2O4, respectively, which are in good agreement with XRD and SEM techniques.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 150 nm Fe3O4-Pt0.15 nanoparticles. However, it does describe a method for the synthesis of Fe3O4@Pt nanoparticles, which might be similar. 

In the described method, DMSA modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles were used in the procedure of Pt deposition. The deposition of Pt on Fe3O4 nanoparticles was achieved by reducing the Pt salt precursor, K2PtCl4, in an aqueous solution. In a typical experiment, 8 mL DMSA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles aqueous solution (11 mM Fe) was taken in a 20 mL flask. The flask was then placed in an ultrasonic bath; the bath temperature was raised to 70 1C and remained the same throughout the experiment. 

2 mL 0.5 mM metal precursor was added to the flask using a pipette. 0.4 mL 0.1 mol/L fresh-prepared NaBH4 solution was added as a reducer after 30 min. The reduction reactions lasted for 2 h. The obtained Fe3O4@Pt nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation and then washed 4 times with deionized water.

The particle morphology of the nanoparticles obtained above was characterized by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100). The structure was detected by an X′TRA X-ray diffractometer (XRD). An energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) was used to determine the element ratio of iron and platinum.

The reaction kinetics for the catalytic oxidation of TMB was studied by recording the absorption spectra with a 30 s interval in scanning kinetics mode using multimode and absorbance microplate readers (TECAN, Infinite 200). Unless otherwise stated, the reaction was carried out at room temperature with 3 mg Fe/mL Fe3O4 nanoparticles or Fe3O4@Pt nanoparticles in 1 mL reaction buffer (sodium citrate buffer, 0.1 M, pH 4.4) in the presence of different concentrations of TMB or H2O2.

The peroxidase-like catalytic activity of the synthesized nanoparticles was also investigated. Catalysis was found to follow Michaelis–Menten kinetics.

The synthesis of Pt NPs (Platinum Nanoparticles) of 5 nm size is described in the article. The preparation of the Pt NPs was performed by chemical reduction of H2PtCl6 with Lysozyme (Lys), which acted as a soft template. A solution of Lys (5 mL, 1–25 mg mL1) reacted with an equal volume of 10 mM H2PtCl6. The mixture was vigorously stirred for 2 min, followed by the rapid addition of NaOH (500 mL, 1 M). The obtained solution was incubated at 37 C overnight. 

To remove excess Lys, a solution of Pt NCs was dialysed with 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3) for two days. The concentration of the obtained Pt NCs is denoted as 1. The preparation of Pt NPs (5 ± 2 nm and 30 ± 4 nm), Au NPs (13 ± 2 nm), and Fe3O4 NPs (13 ± 2 nm) is described in the ESI.

The formation of Pt NCs was confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The maximal fluorescence of Pt NCs appears at 434 nm with a quantum yield of 0.08, a fluorescence lifetime of 3.0 ns, and excitation-dependent emission wavelength behavior. 

The article also mentions that the role of Lys is to act as the sole reducing agent. Thus, a high molar ratio of Lys to H2PtCl6 facilitates the formation of Pt NCs, while a low molar ratio of Lys to H2PtCl6 induces the production of Pt NPs and Pt NCs. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of 5 nm Pt NPs involves the chemical reduction of H2PtCl6 with Lys, followed by the addition of NaOH, and incubation at 37 C overnight. The solution is then dialysed to remove excess Lys. The formation of Pt NCs is confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and FT-IR."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 1700 nm SiAu nanoparticles. However, it does detail the synthesis of bifunctional mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) and their subsequent modification with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). 

The synthesis of bifunctional MSN was carried out according to previous reports with slight modifications. These bifunctional mesoporous materials were synthesized by co-condensation of amino groups onto the internal channels and subsequent grafting of the carboxyl groups onto the external surface. The template CTAB was still in the mesoporous channels, so only the external surface was exposed to the grafting reagent. After removal of template molecules, the highly dispersed AuNPs were allowed to form by in situ reduction of auric chloride ions with NaBH4. 

The successful modification of MSN with amino and carboxyl groups was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. The MSN exhibited an obvious C–H vibration band (2850–2950 cm −1) in its FTIR spectrum, indicating the presence of organic substitution in the modified silica nanoparticles. The successful grafting of amino groups on the surface of MSN could be validated by the appearance of a band at 1580 cm −1, which was attributed to the N–H bending vibration. The emerging absorption band at around 1700 cm −1 in the sample MSN after carboxyl group modification could be assigned to C=O stretching of the carboxyl groups contained within the attached succinic acid molecules.

Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of MSN indicated that the MSN had bean-like morphology with the average length and width around 1.7 and 0.9 µm, respectively. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of MSN demonstrated their porous structure with a total pore volume of 0.838 cm3 g –1, an average pore diameter of 3.42 nm and a narrow pore distribution.

The formation of MSN-AuNPs by reduction of HAuCl4 with NaBH4 was monitored. TEM images, SEM image, and the corresponding size distribution histogram revealed that AuNPs immobilized on MSN were well dispersed, with an average size of 4.46 nm, indicating that most of AuNPs were fixed on the surface of MSN. The TEM elemental mappings further evidenced the uniform distribution of Si, O, and Au elements in the same particle. The modification of AuNPs on the surface of MSN was also confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern."

The preparation of Au@PdPt Alloy NRs involves several steps. First, CTAB-capped Au NRs, prepared using the well-developed seed-mediated growth method, were employed as seeds to initiate the codeposition of PdPt shell. The 2 mM H2PdCl4 or PtCl4 2- aqueous solution was prepared as following: 0.035 g of PdCl2 or 0.0688 g of K2PtCl4 was dissolved in HCl (2 mL, 0.2 M) solution and diluted to 100 mL with water. 

Before the growth of Pt (Pt and Pd, or pure Pd), Au NRs were purified by centrifugation at 8422 g for 7 min twice. After that, a suspension of 1 mL purified Au NRs (0.5 mM according to Au atoms) was mixed with 40 μL of PtCl4 2- (2 mM) and a fixed volume of 2 mM H2PdCl4. To this mixture, a 10 times excess of AA (0.1 M) was added and followed by vigorously shaking. The final volume was adjusted to 3 mL by water. By changing the volume (8-200 μL) of added H2PdCl4, different Pd/Pt ratios can be obtained. 

The reaction took place in several minutes accompanying with a color change from brown to gray and finished after several hours. After 12 h, 200 μL of 0.1 M CTAB was added. The suspensions were centrifuged at 9562 g for 8 min and the precipitate was collected and diluted with H2O to a final concentration of 0.36 nM (according to Au NRs).

For TMB oxidation and Fe(II) ion detection, the surface of NRs was further modified with PSS via electrostatic assembly in order to stabilize them in buffer solutions. The preparation of PSS-coated NRs is as follows: 1.0 mL of NRs suspension was purified by centrifuging (9562 g 8 min). The precipitate was then redispersed in 1.0 mL of water and mixed with 50 μL of 20 mg mL-1 PSS solution (containing 60 mM NaCl). The suspension was placed in a 30 C water bath for at least 3 h. After that, one time centrifugation (9562g, 8 min) was executed to remove the excessive PSS and the precipitate was redispersed in 100 μL water for further use.

The synthesis of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) of approximately 70 nm in size, specifically CS-SeNPs, was achieved through a chemical procedure based on the reduction of sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) with ascorbic acid in the presence of chitosan (CS) as a stabilizer. 

In a typical synthesis of CS-SeNPs, the stock solution of Na2SeO3 (50 mM) and CS (1% w/w) were mixed under vigorous stirring, and then ascorbic acid (100 mM) was added into the mixture. The reaction system was then diluted to 10 mL with double distilled water and the final concentrations of Na2SeO3, ascorbic acid and CS were 5 mM, 20 mM and 3 μM, respectively. The reaction system was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. 

The resulting colloid was dialyzed against double distilled water to remove redundant impurities. Finally, the obtained colloid was centrifuged to abandon the suspension, and the red precipitate was dispersed in double distilled water and stored at 4 °C for further use. CS-SeNPs with different sizes can be synthesized by adding different amounts of CS into the reaction system. 

The as-obtained SeNPs were characterized using microscopic and spectroscopic methods. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) samples were prepared by directly drying a drop of SeNPs solution onto a carbon film coated copper grid. The micrographs and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) were obtained on TEM (Tecnai G220, FEI Co., Netherlands) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. 

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (X’Pert PRO, PANalytical B.V., Netherlands) using Cu Ka radiation with 40 kV and 55 mA in the 2θ range 10°-90°. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were gained by an AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W photoelectron spectrometer (Shimadzu-Kratos, Japan). 

The mean hydrodynamic size of SeNPs in aqueous solution was determined using a dynamic light scattering (DLS) instrument (LB-550, Horiba, Ltd. Japan). Zeta potential was measured to determine the surface charge of particles using NanoZS (Malvern Instrument, Malvern, Worcestershire, United Kingdom). 

A thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA; PerkinElmer TGA8000, USA) was employed to determine the content of organic component in SeNPs. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) spectra of the samples were recorded on IR spectrometer (Equinox 55, Brucker Optics, Germany) in the range of 4000-500 cm−1 using the KBr-disk method. UV–vis absorption spectra were collected in a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550) in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm."

The article does not provide information on the synthesis of 4500 nm Co3Fe nanoparticles. The synthesis process described in the article is for Co–Fe LDHs (Layered Double Hydroxides) with a hierarchical rope-like structure, not nanoparticles. The size of the LDHs is not specified as 4500 nm. 

The synthesis of Co–Fe LDHs was carried out using a hexagonal LLC (Lyotropic Liquid Crystal) as a nanoreactor. The LLC was composed of Triton X-100 and water, based on its well-known binary phase diagram. The water component was substituted by the mixed aqueous solution of CoCl2$6H2O and FeCl3$9H2O. The surfactant concentration was fixed at 48 wt%, and the total cation concentration was selected as 200 mmol L1 with various Co–Fe molar ratios (R) from 1.5 to 4. 

For the preparation of Co–Fe LDHs, the dilute ammonia (6 wt%) was added into the LLC as coprecipitant, whose dosage was four times the theoretical amount needed by the cations. After a designed reaction time (t), the unreacted chemical agents and surfactants were removed by absolute alcohol washing using a re-dispersion–centrifugation cyclic process. All the LDH products were dried at 70 C and ground into powders before using as catalyst. All LDH synthesizing experiments were carried out at 22 C.

The Co–Fe LDH samples prepared with the LLC nanoreactor and traditional coprecipitation method were designated as LLC-LDHs and TCP-LDHs, respectively. The morphologies of the LLC-LDHs synthesized at different Co–Fe molar ratios (R) and reaction times (t) were examined by TEM and SEM techniques. 

For comparison, two Co3Fe TCP-LDH samples were prepared. The first one was synthesized without any addition of surfactant, and the second one was synthesized in the presence of Triton X-100, whose dosage was determined according to the Co–Fe–Triton X-100 molar ratio of 0.75–0.25–0.018 in the above-mentioned Co–Fe LLC-LDH sample. 

However, the article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 4500 nm Co3Fe nanoparticles."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 300 nm Co3Fe nanoparticles. However, it does detail the synthesis of Co–Fe LDHs (Layered Double Hydroxides) using a hexagonal LLC (Lyotropic Liquid Crystal) as a nanoreactor. The Co–Fe LDH nanosheets based hierarchical structure exposed a higher specific surface area and a larger pore volume than the conventional products.

The hexagonal LLC phase was composed of Triton X-100 and water based on its well-known binary phase diagram. To construct the LLC nanoreactor, the water component was substituted by the mixed aqueous solution of CoCl2$6H2O and FeCl3$9H2O. The surfactant concentration was fixed at 48 wt%, and the total cation concentration was selected as 200 mmol L1 with various Co–Fe molar ratios (R) from 1.5 to 4. The LLC sample was repeatedly stirred with a vortex mixer and centrifuged to exclude the air bubbles from the lyotropic phase. After 24 hours of equilibration, a uniform and clear liquid crystal was obtained.

For the preparation of Co–Fe LDHs, the dilute ammonia (6 wt%) was added into the LLC as coprecipitant, whose dosage was four times the theoretical amount needed by the cations. After a designed reaction time (t), the unreacted chemical agents and surfactants were removed by absolute alcohol washing using a re-dispersion–centrifugation cyclic process. All the LDH products were dried at 70 C and ground into powders before using as catalyst.

All LDH synthesizing experiments were carried out at 22 C. For clarity, the Co–Fe LDH samples prepared with the LLC nanoreactor and traditional coprecipitation method were designated as LLC-LDHs and TCP-LDHs, respectively.

The morphologies of the LLC-LDHs synthesized at different Co–Fe molar ratios (R) and reaction times (t) were examined by TEM and SEM techniques. Under the circumstances of R ¼ 1.5 and t ¼ 48 h, the separate sand-rose assemblies composed of LDH nanosheets were obtained. For the R ¼ 3 system at t ¼ 48 h, the sand-rose assemblies tended to be connected with each other and aligned in parallel direction. When the reaction time extended to 96 h for the R ¼ 3 system, a novel morphology, a rope-like assembly, of LDH was observed. The length and the diameter of the rope-like assemblies were about 3–6 mm and 150–300 nm, respectively, and their aspect ratio was as high as 20.

In conclusion, while the article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 300 nm Co3Fe nanoparticles, it does detail the synthesis of Co–Fe LDHs using a hexagonal LLC as a nanoreactor."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of (FeS2)0.3-SiO2 nanoparticles of 1200 nm size. However, it does describe the synthesis process of FeS2/SiO2 DMHSs and FeS2 NPs, which might be similar. 

The synthesis of FeS2/SiO2 DMHSs involves several steps. The sample is first placed under vacuum and heated to 300°C at a rate of 2°C per minute. This temperature is maintained for 5 hours. The sample is then heated again at the same rate to 500°C and kept at this temperature for 3 hours. After the experiment returns to room temperature, the sample is washed with CS2, distilled water, and ethanol. It is then dried at 60°C for 24 hours. The sample is named as FeS2/SiO2 DMHSs.

The synthesis of FeS2 NPs is similar to the above method, where Fe3O4/SiO2 DMHSs are replaced by Fe3O4 NCs. 

Characterization of the synthesized nanoparticles is done using various techniques. These include X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements, High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests, N2 adsorption and desorption measurements, UV-vis absorption spectra and metal ion concentration determination.

The article does not provide specific information on the quantities of reagents used in mmols for the synthesis process. It also does not mention the specific equipment used for the synthesis.

The synthesis of hollow, porous NiS nanocubes, with an average size of approximately 320 nm, was carried out in two steps using Ni–Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as a template. The Ni–Co PBA precursor was synthesized by a hydrothermal method and then characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The average size of the Ni–Co PBA nanocubes was approximately 400 nm, and the edges of the cube were relatively smooth.

The first step in the synthesis involved the preparation of Ni–Co PBA nanocubes according to a previous literature report. Typically, 3 mmol of nickel nitrate hexahydrate and 4.5 mmol of sodium citrate dihydrate were completely dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water, forming solution A. Meanwhile, 2 mmol of potassium hexacyanocobaltate(III) was dissolved in 100 mL deionized water, forming solution B. Solutions A and B were then completely mixed and stirred for 3 minutes. The mixed solution was aged for 24 hours at room temperature. The precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation and then washed three times with ultrapure water and ethanol. Finally, the product was dried under a vacuum at room temperature overnight.

In the second step, 40 mg of Ni–Co PBA was dissolved in 40 mL of ethanol and continuously ultrasonicated for 20 minutes to form solution C. Meanwhile, 17 mL of deionized water was added to a mixture of 1 mmol of thioacetamide and 3 mL of NaOH (1 M) to form solution D. Then, solutions C and D were mixed under continuous magnetic stirring for 5 minutes, and the mixture was placed in a Teflon reaction vessel and heated at 100 °C for 8 hours. The final product was obtained by centrifugation, washed three times with ultrapure water and ethanol, and dried at room temperature to obtain hollow, porous NiS nanocubes.

The characterization of the NiS nanocubes was performed using various techniques. SEM and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with a Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN electron microscope (FEI, USA) operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and a JSM-7500 field-emission scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The crystal phase of the nanomaterial was investigated by X-ray diffraction with a Bruker D8 Phaser X-ray diffractometer. Nitrogen sorption measurements were conducted with an ASAP 3020 instrument at liquid-nitrogen temperature. UV–visible absorption spectra were obtained with a UV-3600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) or a Varioskan Flash spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 12 nm Cu5ZnFe5S6 nanoparticles. The synthesis process described in the article is for CuZnFeS (CZIS) nanocrystals (NCs), not specifically for Cu5ZnFe5S6 nanoparticles. 

The synthesis of CZIS NCs involves several steps. First, 3 mL ODE was quickly injected at 200 °C and annealed further for 2 minutes. The reaction system was then allowed to cool down to room temperature. CIS NCs are prepared in the same manner by adding 0.1 mmol iron(III) acetylacetonate instead of 0.1 mmol zinc(II) chloride. The as-prepared NCs were purified by several cycles of the precipitation–dispersion method using chloroform and ethanol.

To explore the peroxidase-like catalytic activity of the NCs in aqueous medium, as synthesized OLA and OA capped CZIS NCs are exchanged with 3-mercaptopropanoic acid (MPA) to get M-CZIS NCs. In a typical procedure, 50 mg of hydrophobic NCs (OLA and OA capped) were dissolved in 3 mL chloroform. Then the aqueous solution of MPA (pH of the solution adjusted to greater than ten by adding sodium hydroxide or tetramethylammonium hydroxide) was added drop-wise under vigorous stirring. Stirring was performed for 30 minutes. A separation of two distinct layers of chloroform and NCs was observed, after stopping the stirring. The NCs were separated out by centrifugation and washed two times with chloroform to remove un-exchanged OA and OLA. The NCs were further dispersed in water and precipitated out with acetone to remove excess MPA. Finally the resulting NCs were dried under vacuum and stored for further characterization.

Characterization of the NCs was carried out using various techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) investigations were carried out using a JEOL JEM-2010 microscope operating at 200 kV. Elemental analysis was carried out using X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements with an Omicron X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM-HAADF) measurements were carried out using a FEI, TF30-ST microscope operating at 300 kV equipped with a scanning unit and an HAADF detector from Fischione (model 3000). Energy filtered TEM (EFTEM) images were acquired using Gatan Imaging Filter. Compositional analysis was performed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) attached to TF30. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advanced diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å). UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra were recorded with a Varian-cary-5000 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Jobin Yvon nanolog spectrophotometer by dispersing the NCs in tetrachloroethylene/water."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 2 nm gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). The article discusses the synthesis and modification of gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), not nanoparticles. The size of these nanoclusters is not specified in the article. 

The synthesis of keratin-capped AuNCs was performed by modifying a previously reported method. To obtain AuNCs with high peroxidase-like activity, different concentrations of keratin and different synthesis times were optimized. The suitable reagent concentration was selected as 15 mg·mL−1 keratin with 5 mM HAuCl4 and the synthesis time was selected as 14 hours.

AuNC-Cu2+ were prepared by simply mixing AuNCs with Cu2+ ions. First, AuNCs were purified by filtering with a Sephadex G25 size exclusion column (SEC). Second, 1 mL of a purified AuNC solution (2 mg·mL−1) was added to 1 mL of copper sulfate (0–444 μM) at room temperature and allowed to react for 6 hours with gentle stirring. Finally, AuNC-Cu2+ were stored at 4 °C for further use.

The structure of AuNC-Cu2+ was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 2 nm gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). However, it does describe the preparation of keratin-capped gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) and their modification with copper(II) ions.

The synthesis of keratin-capped AuNCs was achieved by modifying a previously reported method. To obtain AuNCs with high peroxidase-like activity, different concentrations of keratin and different synthesis times were optimized. Considering the peroxidase-like activity of AuNCs and the interference of the background signal, 15 mg·mL−1 keratin with 5 mM HAuCl4 was selected as the suitable reagent concentration and 14 h was selected as the synthesis time.

AuNC-Cu2+ were prepared by simply mixing AuNCs with Cu2+ ions. First, AuNCs were purified by filtering with a Sephadex G25 size exclusion column (SEC). Second, 1 mL of a purified AuNC solution (2 mg·mL−1) was added to 1 mL of copper sulfate (0–444 μM) at room temperature and allowed to react for 6 h with gentle stirring. Finally, AuNC-Cu2+ were stored at 4 °C for further use.

The structure of AuNC-Cu2+ was investigated by TEM (JEOL JEM-2100), UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Shimadzu UV-1601PC), fluorescence spectroscopy (Edinburgh FS-5), XRD (Shimadzu D/Max-2500) and XPS (Physical Electronics PHI 5600). No significant differences were observed in the TEM images, UV spectra or XRD patterns, while the fluorescence signal showed a large difference. These data suggest that the interaction between AuNCs and Cu2+ ions was mainly focused on the interactions between Au and Cu atoms.

To further investigate the interactions between AuNCs and copper ions, the chemical states of Au and Cu in the samples were obtained by XPS. The Au 4f7/2 spectrum can be fitted to two peaks: 84.1 and 84.9 eV, corresponding to Au0 and Au+, respectively. After adding Cu2+ ions, almost all of the Au in AuNC-Cu2+ was in a reduced state (Au0). The disappearance of Au+ may be due to the formation of an Au-Cu alloy or Cu+(d10)-Au+(d10) metallophilic bonds. Furthermore, the XPS peak of 932.8 eV for the Cu 2p3/2 electron indicated that the copper atoms in AuNC-Cu2+ exist in Cu+ or Cu0 valance states. The absence of the peak at 942 eV reflects the absence of Cu2+ in AuNC-Cu2+."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 100 nm Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs). However, it does describe the synthesis of Fe3O4-MMT nanocomposites (NCs). The procedure involves the use of montmorillonite (MMT) and FeSO4·7H2O. 

The modified procedure is as follows: MMT (0.25 g) is dispersed into distilled water (10 mL) under vigorous stirring for 18 hours to form a well-dispersed MMT dispersion. Subsequently, FeSO4·7H2O aqueous solution (1 mL, 3 M) is added dropwise to the MMT dispersed mixture and violently stirred for another 1 hour to ensure that Fe2+ can be well dispersed on the surface of MMT. 

The morphologies of the nanocomposites were imaged by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a field-emission microscope (JSM 7600F) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) performed using a JEM-2100 (JEOL, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV for characterizing the morphology and size of the product. 

The phase of the obtained Fe3O4-MMT nanocomposites were characterized by the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (a D/max 2550 VB/PC diffractometer, Rigaku, Japan) using Cu Kɑ radiation (λ=0.15418 nm). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) experiments were performed by using a NICOLET 380 Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (Nicolet Thermo, USA) by detecting the compressed pellet obtained by mixing the sample with KBr. 

X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) was performed on a Scanning X-ray Microprobe (ESCSLAB 250Xi, ThermoFisher, USA), and the binding energy (BE) was calibrated using the C (1s) peak at 284.6 eV. The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a MAPADA UV-8000PC spectrophotometer (Beijing, China). The fluorometric data were recorded on a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorophotometer (Varian, Inc, USA).

The article also mentions that Fe3O4 nanoparticles, as the first reported artificial enzymes, were found to possess an intrinsic peroxidase-like activity. Various preparation methods for Fe3O4 nanoparticles, including coprecipitation, thermal decomposition, polyol route, hydrothermal process, and solvothermal technique, have been reported. Furthermore, various nanostructures of Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared, such as zero dimensional nanoparticles (nanosphere, nanooctahedron, and nanocube), one-dimensional nanostructures (nanorod, nanowire, and nanotube) and two-dimensional nanostructures (nanoring, nanoplate, and nanoprism).

However, Fe3O4 NPs were easy to aggregate together, due to its magnetic attractive forces and the long-rang van der Waals attractive forces. It is necessary to employ a support to solve this problem. Montmorillonite (MMT), as an important class of natural host-guest layered materials, can be used as a support to decrease high aggregation.

The synthesis of the MoS2/PPy nanocomposite, which includes MoS2 nanoparticles, is described in the article. The unique algae-like MoS2/PPy nanocomposite was prepared in a one-pot synthesis under a hydrothermal process through the redox reaction between ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and pyrrole monomer. 

Initially, 20.5 mg of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate was dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water under stirring. After stirring for about 10 minutes, 20 µL of pyrrole monomer was added into the solution and stirred for another 10 minutes. The mixed solution was then transferred into a 40 mL Teflon-Lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 15 hours. 

After cooling to room temperature, the resulting black precipitates of MoS2/PPy were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 r min−1. The obtained product was then washed with distilled water and ethanol several times to remove the residue or reactants, and dried at 40 °C for 24 hours under vacuum to obtain a black powder (MoS2/PPy). 

For comparison, the amount of pyrrole monomer was changed to 40 µL in the reaction to obtain a composition marked as MoS2/PPy-2. Pure MoS2 nanostructure was also synthesized by the reduction of MoS2 in the presence of hydrazine. Polypyrrole was also produced with oxidization by ammonium peroxydisulfate under a hydrothermal process.

The article does not specify the size of the MoS2 nanoparticles in the composite, but it does mention that the composite has a unique algae-like structure and that the MoS2 nanosheets in the MoS2/PPy nanocomposite may contain only a few layers. The exact size of the nanoparticles may depend on the specific conditions of the synthesis, such as the reaction time, temperature, and the concentration of the reactants."

The synthesis of algae-like molybdenum disulfide/polypyrrole (MoS2/PPy) nanocomposite, which includes MoS2 nanoparticles, is described in the article. The process involves a one-pot synthetic route through a redox reaction between ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and pyrrole monomer under hydrothermal conditions, without the need for any other templates. 

The procedure is as follows: 20.5 mg of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate is first dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water under stirring. After stirring for about 10 minutes, 20 µL of pyrrole monomer is added to the solution and stirred for another 10 minutes.

However, it mentions that the obtained MoS2/PPy nanocomposite displayed an algae-like morphology with a diameter of about several hundred nanometers, which is composed of several folded thin pieces.

The article does not provide specific instructions for synthesizing 100 nm Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs). However, it does describe a procedure for creating Fe3O4 NPs of unspecified size. 

The procedure begins with the addition of C6H5Na3O7·2H2O (citric acid, 1 mM), NaOH (4 mM), and NaNO3 (0.2 M) to deionized water (19 mL). This mixture is heated to 100 °C to form a pellucid solution. Then, a solution of FeSO4·7H2O (1 mL, 2 M) is rapidly added to the mixture, which is equivalent to 0.10 M Fe2+ in the alkaline pellucid solution. This mixed solution is transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 100 °C for 1 hour. After this time, the solution is naturally cooled to room temperature.

The Fe3O4 NPs are then separated from the solvent using a magnet, rinsed with deionized water several times, and dried at 50 °C for approximately 10 hours. The resulting black powder is then ready for further functionalization with H2TCPP in the subsequent experiment.

The article also describes the preparation of H2TCPP-functionalized Fe3O4 nanocomposites. H2TCPP (5 mg) is dissolved in ultrapure water (1 mL) and the pH of the solution is adjusted to 8 using a dilute NaOH solution. This solution is assigned as solution A. The prepared Fe3O4 NPs (10 mg) are dispersed in ultrapure water (5 mL), and this is assigned as solution B. The mixture of solution A and B is treated under ultrasonic conditions for 1.5 hours. The precipitates are then separated using a magnet and dried in air. The target product is successfully obtained and studied in the subsequent experiment.

The characterization of the produced nanostructures of H2TCPP-Fe3O4 is done using various techniques. The morphologies are imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, Japan). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra are recorded on a NICOLET 380 FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet Thermo, USA) using a KBr disk method. Absorption spectra are recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-3200PC) (Shanghai, China). Fluorometric measurements are carried out by a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorophotometer (Varian, Inc., USA). The crystal structures of the products are determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (D/Max2500PC, Rigaku)."

Then, FeSO4·7H2O (1 mL, 2 M) solution is rapidly added to the mixture (equivalent to 0.10 M Fe2+ in the alkaline pellucid solution) and the mixed solution is transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave is maintained at 100 °C for 1 h. After 1 h, the solution is naturally cooled to room temperature.

The Fe3O4 NPs are then separated from the solvent using a magnet, rinsed with deionized water several times and dried at 50 °C for one night (approximately 10 hours). The obtained black powder is then used for being functionalized with H2TCPP in the subsequent experiment.

For the preparation of H2TCPP-functionalized Fe3O4 nanocomposites, H2TCPP (5 mg) is dissolved in ultrapure water (1 mL) and the pH of the solution is adjusted to 8 using dilute NaOH solution. This solution is assigned as solution A. The prepared Fe3O4 NPs (10 mg) are dispersed in ultrapure water (5 mL), and this is assigned as solution B. The mixture of solution A and B is treated under ultrasonic conditions for 1.5 h. The precipitates are then separated using a magnet and dried in air. The target product is successfully obtained and studied in the subsequent experiment.

The characterization of the produced nanostructures of H2TCPP-Fe3O4 is done using various techniques. The morphologies are imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, Japan). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra are recorded on a NICOLET 380 FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet Thermo, USA) using a KBr disk method. Absorption spectra are recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-3200PC) (Shanghai, China). Fluorometric measurements are carried out by a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorophotometer (Varian, Inc., USA).

The manuscript does not provide specific details on the size of the Fe3O4 NPs produced. However, it does mention that the SEM images show the pure Fe3O4 NPs with a diameter of 30 nm slightly aggregated due to their magnetic properties. The size of the nanoparticles may be influenced by the specific conditions of the synthesis, such as the concentration of the reagents, the temperature, and the duration of the reaction."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 30000 nm Ag nanoparticles. However, it does detail the process for the synthesis of Ag nanowires and Ag@Fe3O4 nanowires. 

For the preparation of Ag nanowire, a polyol route was used. Ethylene glycol (EG) (20ml) was heated in an oil bath at 150 °C for 1 h before adding silver nitrate and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Then 5 ml of silver nitrate EG solution (containing 0.24 mol of AgNO3 in EG) and 5 ml of PVP EG solution (containing 0.24 mol of PVP calculated on the monomer) were added dropwise simultaneously. The mixture turned yellow immediately after the first drop of silver nitrate and PVP/EG solutions was added. The solution became opaque gradually with the injection and turned turbid with a gray color in about 15 min, indicating the appearance of Ag nanowire. The reaction was continued at 150 °C for another 3 h. After finishing the reaction a gray precipitate remained. Finally, the products were washed nine times with ethanol, dried at 30 °C for 6 h.

For the preparation of Ag@Fe3O4 nanowire, Ag nanowire (0.01 mmol) and Fe(NO3)3 (0.04 mmol) were dissolved in 11 ml of diglycol, then sodium acetate (0.12 mol) and 3 ml of EG were added in turn, a orange-yellow solution was then obtained. The resultant mixture was transferred to 20 ml of teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was sealed and maintained at 200 °C for 10 h. The autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally. The precipitate, Ag@Fe3O4 (sample 1) was washed with distilled water and ethanol for nine times, and dried at 30 °C for 6 h. Changing the quality of Fe(NO3)3 to 0.12 mmol and 0.2 mmol, Ag@Fe3O4 nanocomposite with different content of iron (sample 2, sample 3) were obtained, respectively.

The phases of the as-prepared products were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD-6000) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 A). The morphologies, sizes of the products were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6480) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100). UV-vis spectra were collected on Hitachi UV-3000 spectrophotometer."

The article describes the synthesis of N-doped MoS2 nanosheets, not nanoparticles. The synthesis process involves a hydrothermal route and a subsequent plasma treatment. 

The initial MoS2 nanosheets were fabricated using Na2MoO4 and thiourea according to a modified one-pot hydrothermal route. Specifically, Na2MoO4·2H2O (0.40 g) was dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water to form a clear solution by intense stirring, followed by the addition of thiourea (0.63 g) that was stirred for 20 min to form a homogeneous solution. The homogeneous solution was then transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave to be heated at 200 °C for 24 h. After the autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature naturally, the resulting black products were collected by centrifuging for 10 min and then washed with water and ethanol several times. The yielded MoS2 nanosheets were freeze-dried for 12 h to be stored at room temperature.

The N-doped MoS2 nanosheets were obtained by treating MoS2 nanosheets under the plasma conditions of 13.56 MHz RF plasma at a power of 45 W and a voltage of 230 V. All of the N2 plasma treatments were performed in the reaction chamber, into which N2 was introduced at a flowing rate of 50 sccm, with an operating pressure kept at 100 Pa. An aliquot of MoS2 was spread on the quartz plate in the plasma chamber to be treated for different times (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, and 10 min) at room temperature.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 300 nm or other size N0.1-MoS2 nanoparticles. However, it does detail the preparation of N-doped MoS2 nanosheets, which may be relevant.

MoS2 nanosheets were fabricated using Na2MoO4 and thiourea according to a modified one-pot hydrothermal route. Specifically, Na2MoO4·2H2O (0.40 g) was dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water to form a clear solution by intense stirring, followed by the addition of thiourea (0.63 g) that was stirred for 20 min to form a homogeneous solution. The homogeneous solution was then transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave to be heated at 200 °C for 24 h. After the autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature naturally, the resulting black products were collected by centrifuging for 10 min and then washed with water and ethanol several times. The yielded MoS2 nanosheets were freeze-dried for 12 h to be stored at room temperature.

The N-doped MoS2 nanosheets were obtained by treating MoS2 nanosheets under the plasma conditions of 13.56 MHz RF plasma at a power of 45 W and a voltage of 230 V. All of the N2 plasma treatments were performed in the reaction chamber, into which N2 was introduced at a flowing rate of 50 sccm, with an operating pressure kept at 100 Pa. An aliquot of MoS2 was spread on the quartz plate in the plasma chamber to be treated for different times (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, and 10 min) at room temperature. The so-obtained N-doped MoS2 nanosheets were stored for the catalysis experiments.

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of PtFe nanoparticles (NPs). It mentions the use of PtFe alloy nanorods (NRs) with less platinum but improved activity for H2O2 activation to construct the PtFe@Fe3O4 NRs. However, the exact process, reagents, and parameters for synthesizing these PtFe NRs are not described in the provided text. 

The article does detail the process of assembling the PtFe@Fe3O4 NRs. This was done by assembling multiple uniform Fe3O4 NPs on the surface of the as-prepared PtFe NRs. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images showed that Fe3O4 NPs with a diameter of mainly 5−20 nm attached to ultrafine PtFe NRs with a length of about 140 nm and width about 2 nm. 

The composition of PtFe@Fe3O4 NRs was confirmed using scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray (STEM-EDX) elemental mapping and STEM-EDX line scan. The distributions of Pt is even through the whole nanorods. And the distribution of Fe and O elements are in the same particle, which also suggested the attachment of Fe3O4 NPs on the surface of PtFe NRs. 

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to determine the fine structure of PtFe@Fe3O4 NRs. According to the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), the mass ratio of Pt and Fe in PtFe NRs was 49:51, and the percentage of PtFe and Fe3O4 in PtFe@Fe3O4 NRs were estimated to be 32 wt% and 68 wt%, respectively.

In conclusion, while the article provides some information on the assembly and characterization of PtFe@Fe3O4 NRs, it does not provide specific details on the synthesis of the PtFe NPs themselves."

The synthesis of Co3O4 nanocrystals, or nanoparticles (NPs), was carried out according to a previously reported method with slight modifications. The materials used for the synthesis included Cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (99.5%) and benzyl alcohol, both purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). 

In a typical procedure, 160 mg of Co(II) acetate and 7 ml of benzyl alcohol were added to a round bottom flask. The mixture was stirred at room temperature until the solution became transparent. After that, 7 mL of ammonium hydroxide (25%) solution was added dropwise into the flask under vigorous stirring. 

The flask was then placed into an oil bath adjusted at a constant temperature of 165 °C. The solution was boiled immediately and after about 5 minutes, a water condenser was installed. The reaction system was kept at 165 °C for 2 hours with stirring. 

Afterwards, the mixture was cooled to room temperature. Methyl tert-butyl ether was then added to the reaction solution, resulting in a black precipitate. The black precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol. 

The Co3O4 nanocrystals (4 mg) were then dispersed into distilled water (20 mL) to obtain a suspension of Co3O4 nanocrystals (200 μg mL-1). The morphology of the obtained Co3O4 nanocrystals was studied using a transmission electron microscope (TEM), which showed that the as-prepared Co3O4 nanocrystals had a cube-like shape and were well-dispersed. The average size determined by TEM was 5 nm. 

The elemental compositions and the oxidation states of the Co3O4 nanocrystals were further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectra of XPS showed that the as-prepared Co3O4 nanocrystals only contained Co, O, and C elements. The high-resolution Co 2p spectrum showed that cobalt existed in a mixed-valence state of +2 and +3 in the obtained nanocrystals, which further confirmed the existence of Co3O4. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of Co3O4 NPs involves a series of steps including the preparation of a solution of Co(II) acetate and benzyl alcohol, the addition of ammonium hydroxide, heating and stirring, cooling, and the addition of methyl tert-butyl ether. The resulting NPs are then dispersed in distilled water. The size and composition of the NPs are confirmed using TEM and XPS."

The synthesis of Pd@Pt core–frame nanodendrites, which can be considered as nanoparticles (NPs), is described in the article. The process involves two main steps: selective deposition of Pt atoms on the surface of Pd nanocubes, followed by the growth of Pt branches to generate Pd@Pt core–frame nanodendrites; and the generation of Pt hollow nanodendrites via selective etching of the Pd cores using FeBr3.

In the first step, Pt atoms were selectively deposited on the corners and edges of prepared Pd nanocubes, due to their higher surface energies relative to the side faces capped by Br− ions. Then, Pt atoms gradually diffuse to the side faces and grow into abundant branches, generating Pd@Pt core–frame nanodendrites. 

The Pd nanocubes (18 nm in edge length) were synthesized using a published protocol. A mixture of PVP (105 mg), AA (60 mg), and KBr (600 mg) were dissolved in 8 mL ultrapure water and the solution was heated at 80 °C for 10 min with stirring. Then, an aqueous solution (3 mL) containing Na2PdCl4 (57 mg) was quickly added. The mixture was kept at 80 °C for a further 3 h and cooled down to ambient temperature. After that, the product was collected by centrifugation, washed twice with water, and redispersed in 10 mL EG.

For the synthesis of Pd@Pt Core–Frame Nanodendrites, 2.5 mL of Pd nanocubes (1.2 mg mL−1), PVP (166 mg), AA (250 mg), KBr (162 mg), and EG (30 mL) were mixed in a three-neck flask and heated at 110 °C for 1 h with stirring. The temperature was quickly increased to 190 °C, and 30 mL of an EG solution containing Na2PtCl6 ·6H2O (0.3 mg mL−1) was then added dropwise with a flow rate of 20 mL h−1. After completing the injection, the reaction solution was cooled to ambient temperature. The product was collected by centrifugation, washed twice with ethanol and then washed three times with water, and redispersed in ultrapure water.

In the second step, the Pd core is etched away to form Pt hollow nanodendrites by chemical etching using FeBr3 due to the higher reduction potential of Fe3+/Fe2+ than PdCl4 2−/Pd, as well as its higher resistance to oxidative corrosion of Pt atoms than Pd. Chemical etching was conducted in an acidic aqueous solution to generate the Pt hollow nanodendrites. Typically, KBr (1200 mg), PVP (200 mg), FeCl3 (200 mg), HCl (1.2 mL), H2O (22.8 mL), and 4 mL of the prepared Pd@Pt core−shell nanodendrites were mixed together in a 50 mL flask. The mixture was transferred into an oil bath heated at 100 °C with stirring for 3 h. The product was collected by centrifugation, washed twice with ethanol and then washed three times with water, and finally redispersed in water for further characterization.

The concentration of nanocrystals was measured by ICP-MS (Element 2, Thermo Finnigan, Germany). TEM images were obtained using a Tecnai G2 spirit BioTwin (FEI, USA) electron microscope operated at 120 kV. HRTEM, high-resolution HAADF-STEM, and EDX analyses were performed using a Tecnai F20 microscope (FEI, USA) operated at 200 kV."

Then, an aqueous solution (3 mL) containing Sodium palladium (II) chloride (Na2PdCl4, 57 mg) is quickly added. The mixture is kept at 80 °C for a further 3 h and cooled down to ambient temperature. After that, the product is collected by centrifugation, washed twice with water, and redispersed in 10 mL ethylene glycol (EG).

In the second step, 2.5 mL of Pd nanocubes (1.2 mg mL−1), PVP (166 mg), AA (250 mg), KBr (162 mg), and EG (30 mL) are mixed in a three-neck flask and heated at 110 °C for 1 h with stirring.

After completing the injection, the reaction solution is cooled to ambient temperature. The product is collected by centrifugation, washed twice with ethanol and then washed three times with water, and redispersed in ultrapure water.

The formation of Pt hollow nanodendrites is confirmed by high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) imaging and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping. The concentration of nanocrystals is measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

The article describes the synthesis of NiCo2S4 microflowers, not nanoparticles. However, the method used might be applicable for the synthesis of nanoparticles with some modifications. 

NiCo2S4 was prepared by a precursor method with minor changes. Firstly, Ni and Co-based precursors were synthesized. The mixed solution containing 60 mL deionized water, 8 mmol cobalt chloride hydrate, 4 mmol nickel chloride hydrate and 36 mmol urea were fully dissolved and transferred to a stainless-steel autoclave. The mixture reacted at 120 ◦C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the pink product was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol twice, and then dried at 60 ◦C for 8 h. 

Secondly, the synthesis of NiCo2S4 was to completely dissolve 0.25 g Ni, Co-based precursor in 60 mL deionized water followed by adding 0.75 g NaS2⋅9H2O under stirring. After completely mixed, the black reaction liquid was moved to a stainless-steel autoclave and heated for 6 h at 160 ◦C. When cooling to room temperature, the black product was collected, washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried at 60 ◦C for 8 h.

The actual morphology and size of the precursor and NiCo2S4 samples were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It can be estimated from Fig. 2 that the average size of the prepared NiCo2S4 particles is approximately 2.5 μm. The EDS analysis revealed the presence of Ni, Co, and S. Furthermore, the EDS mapping showed that Ni, Co, and S were uniformly distributed in the NiCo2S4 sample, indicating that the synthesized sample was relatively uniform.

XPS (X-ray photoelectron) was used to obtain further information about the structure and composition of the NiCo2S4 microflowers. All the spectra were fitted using the Gaussian fitting method. These results indicate the presence of Ni2+, Ni3+, Co2+, Co3+ and S2− on the surface of the prepared samples.

Please note that the article does not provide information on how to control the size of the particles to specifically obtain nanoparticles. The size of the particles might be influenced by the reaction conditions, such as temperature, reaction time, and the concentration of the precursors."

After cooling to room temperature, the pink product was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol twice, and then dried at 60 ◦C for 8 h.

Secondly, the synthesis of NiCo2S4 was carried out by completely dissolving 0.25 g Ni, Co-based precursor in 60 mL deionized water followed by adding 0.75 g NaS2⋅9H2O under stirring. After completely mixed, the black reaction liquid was moved to a stainless-steel autoclave and heated for 6 h at 160 ◦C. When cooling to room temperature, the black product was collected, washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried at 60 ◦C for 8 h.

The actual morphology and size of the precursor and NiCo2S4 samples were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It can be estimated from Fig. 2 that the average size of the prepared NiCo2S4 particles is approximately 2.5 μm. The EDS analysis revealed the presence of Ni, Co, and S. Furthermore, the EDS mapping showed that Ni, Co, and S were uniformly distributed in the NiCo2S4 sample, indicating that the synthesized sample was relatively uniform.

In conclusion, while the article does not provide a specific method for synthesizing 2500 nm NiCo2S4 nanoparticles, it does describe a method for synthesizing NiCo2S4 microflowers. The size of the synthesized particles can be controlled by adjusting the parameters of the synthesis process, such as the reaction time, temperature, and the concentration of the precursors. However, further research would be needed to determine the exact conditions for synthesizing 2500 nm NiCo2S4 nanoparticles."

The synthesis of PVP/PtRu NZs (nanoparticles) is described in the article. A schematic of the synthesis of the PVP/PtRu NZs is illustrated in Fig. S1. 50 mg (5 μmol) of PVP10 was dissolved in 47 mL of deionized (DI) water and stirred to achieve homogeneous mixing. Sequentially, 1 mL each of 20 mM H2PtCl6⋅xH2O, and 20 mM RuCl3 were added to the PVP10 solution with continuous stirring (600 rpm), and the temperature was raised to 50 ◦C. Then, 1 mL of 80 mM NaBH4 in ice-cold DI water was added and left under continuous stirring for 3 h to complete the reaction. The obtained solution was dialyzed for 48 h to neutralize the pH and remove side products. Finally, the PVP/PtRu NZs were stored at 4 ◦C until further use.

The concentration of PVP/PtRu NZs in an aqueous medium was measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, SPECTRO ARCOS). The surface charge of the nanostructures was confirmed using dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer, Malvern ZEN3690, UK). The crystallinity of synthesized nanostructures was characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D/MAX-2500, Rigaku, USA). The morphology was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010, Japan). The chemical states of PVP/PtRu NZs were obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG SCIENTA R3000, UK). The UV–vis and fluorescence spectra were measured on an OPTIZED 2120UV spectrometer (MEcasys Co. LTd., South Korea) and a Synergy MX multi-mode microscopic reader (BioTek Instrument Inc., USA), respectively.

The TEM image of PVP/PtRu NZs showed an average size of 3.53 ± 0.84 nm. The inset of Fig. 1C displays the histogram for the size distribution of PVP/PtRu NZs. This result showed that the use of PVP as a stabilizing agent and surfactant provided good dispersity and homogeneity to the PtRu NZs. Moreover, good attachment of PVP on the surface of PtRu led to a decrease in particles size. The Pt–Ru atomic ratio in the PVP/PtRu NZs was estimated with EDX to be 1:1. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of PVP/PtRu NZs involves the use of PVP10, H2PtCl6⋅xH2O, RuCl3, and NaBH4, with the process involving dissolution, stirring, temperature control, and dialysis. The characterization of the synthesized nanoparticles involves the use of various equipment such as ICP-AES, Zetasizer, XRD, TEM, XPS, and spectrometers. The size of the nanoparticles can be controlled by the use of PVP as a stabilizing agent and surfactant."

The article describes the synthesis of NiO nanoparticles (NPs) through a hydrothermal method. The specific size of the nanoparticles, such as 65 nm, is not explicitly mentioned in the synthesis process. However, the article does mention that the NiO nanoparticles formed are cachet-like nanoparticles with an average size of 32 nm in width and 65 nm in length.

In the synthesis process, Nickel chloride (NiCl3 6H2O) is used as the starting material. Specifically, 0.0015 mol of NiCl3 6H2O is dissolved in a mixture of water (5 ml) and ethanol (7.5 ml). Then, NH3 H2O (1.25 ml) is added dropwise to the solution. The resulting suspension is transferred into a 25 ml teflon-lined autoclave, which is then heated at 150 °C for 3 hours. After the system is allowed to cool to room temperature naturally, the final product Ni(OH)3 is obtained. This product is washed with deionized water and dried at 40 °C for 12 hours. Finally, the product is calcined for 4 hours at 500 °C to obtain the NiO nanoparticles.

The article does not provide specific details on the control of the size of the nanoparticles during the synthesis process. The size of the nanoparticles might be influenced by factors such as the concentration of the starting materials, the temperature and duration of the hydrothermal process, and the calcination conditions. However, these factors are not explicitly discussed in the article.

The characterization of the nanoparticles is performed using various techniques. The morphology and size distribution of the nanoparticles are studied using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The crystal structures of the products are determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) are recorded to confirm the coordination interaction between organic ligands and metal elements.

In summary, the synthesis of NiO nanoparticles as described in the article involves a hydrothermal process using nickel chloride as the starting material, followed by washing, drying, and calcination.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 209 nm CuS nanoparticles. However, it does detail the synthesis of CuS-MMT nanocomposites, which involve the creation of CuS nanoparticles. The process is as follows:

CuS-MMT nanocomposites were prepared by dissolving 0.3 g of MMT in 30 mL distilled water under vigorous stirring for 18 hours to form a homogeneous suspension. Then, 5 mL of the CuCl2 aqueous solution (0.15 mmol) were dropwise added into the above suspension under vigorous stirring for another 3 hours. The resulting solution was assigned as solution A. Subsequently, 9 mL HCl solution (0.5 M) was added into another beaker containing 0.169 g of thioacetamide (assigned as solution B). Then solutions A and B were immediately put into a sealed container under vigorous stirring for 24 hours. The final products were separated by centrifugation, washed with pure water three times, and dried at 60 oC for 8 hours in the air.

The morphology and shape of the nanoparticles were obtained by the transmission electron microscope and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan). The crystal structures of the products were recorded on powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with graphite monochromatized Cu Kɑ radiation (D/Max2500PC, Rigaku). The elemental composition of the complex was identified by using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). 

The TEM images show that the as-prepared CuS nanoparticles with an average size of approximately 38 nm were dispersed on the surface of MMT. The interlamellar spacings of MMT and CuS-MMT were almost consistent (approximately 1.50 nm, (001) lattice plane), providing a direct evidence that CuS nanoparticles were dispersed on the surface of MMT.

In conclusion, while the article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 209 nm CuS nanoparticles, it does detail a method for creating CuS nanoparticles of approximately 38 nm in size as part of a CuS-MMT nanocomposite. The process involves the use of MMT, CuCl2, HCl, and thioacetamide, along with various pieces of equipment such as a transmission electron microscope, an X-ray diffractometer, and an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy device."

The synthesis of hollow copper sulfide nanocubes (h-CuS NCs) of about 50 nm size was carried out using cuprous oxide nanoparticles as a template. The following reagents were used: 85.2 mg of copper(II) chloride dehydrate (CuCl2 2H2O), 0.5 g of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), 2.5 mL of 0.2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 2.5 mL of 0.1 M L-ascorbic acid, and 2.0 mL of 1.0 M sodium hydrogen sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S 9H2O). All solutions were prepared with ultrapure water (18.25 MΩ•cm) from the Aquapro water purification system.

In a typical experiment, firstly, CuCl2 2H2O and PVP were dissolved into 200 mL of water. After the solution was stirred for 5 minutes, NaOH was added dropwise. Then, L-ascorbic acid was dropwise added into the solution just 5 min after all NaOH was added. The mixture was continuously stirred for 5 min at room temperature. The solution was heated to 60 °C by heating in a water bath. Then, Na2S aqueous solution was added to the above solution, and the solution immediately became black and reacted at 60 °C for 3 h under stirring. 

The unreacted impurity was washed out by three centrifugation steps with water and ethanol (12000 rpm for 8 min). The product was dried for future research. The morphology and nanoparticles size of the as-prepared h-CuS NCs were obtained using a FEI-Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) were recorded on a Bruker D8A25 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. 

The h-CuS NCs were successfully prepared with peroxidase-like activity using the freshly prepared Cu2O nanoparticles as a template by one pot method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the synthesized h-CuS NCs and the standard diffraction peaks were presented. It is ascertained that all the peaks of the freshly prepared sample coincide with the hexagonal phase of the covellite structure (JCPDS-PDF 06-0464, a = b = 3.792 Å, c = 16.344 Å). The results showed the h-CuS NCs are favorable crystallinity and the high purity of CuS samples."

The XRD pattern of Cu2O nanocubes as precursor of h-CuS NCs can be assigned perfectly to cubic cuprous oxide, confirming the pure phase of Cu2O. The Cu2O samples appeared cubical and homogeneous with an expected size of about 50 nm. 

To further scrutinize the morphology and crystallographic characteristics of the h-CuS NCs, the morphology and nanoparticles size of the as-prepared h-CuS NCs were obtained using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The TEM image of the synthesized h-CuS NCs showed hollow cube-like crystals uniformly dispersed with a size of 50 nm. The HRTEM image of the h-CuS NCs revealed two distinct lattice fringes, where d=0.305 nm is assigned to the (102), and d=0.322 nm is assigned to the (101), which are well consistent with the XRD results of h-CuS NCs."

The synthesis of apoferritin paired gold clusters (Au–Ft), which are gold nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter of less than 2 nm, is described in the article. The preparation of Au–Ft was carried out in an aqueous solution. To begin, 300 μL of 5 mM HAuCl4 was added to 300 μL of horse spleen apoFt (49 mg/mL). To avoid apoFt subunit dissociation under acidic conditions, HAuCl4 was first adjusted to pH 7 before mixing with apoFt. 

After the mixture was mixed for 2 min, 20 μL of 1 M NaOH was added to the solution, followed by incubation for 12 h at 37 °C. The reaction solution was then ultrafiltered with a centrifugal filter device (Amicon Ultra-15; 30,000 molecular weight cut off) and washed three times with 3 mL of ultrapure water. The concentration of Au–Ft was measured by the bicinchoninic acid method (BCA). 

For the characterization of the synthesized Au–Ft, an aliquot of 4 μL of Au–Ft was applied to a glow-discharged grid coated with a layer of amorphous carbon film, and excess fluid was gently blotted off with filter paper. The HRTEM images were recorded on an FEI Tecnai F20 U-TWIN electron microscope. TEM analysis was performed on a JEOL JEM-1200EX model transmission electron microscope. For negative staining, a dispersion of Au–Ft clusters was dropped onto a carbon-coated copper grid, dried in air at room temperature, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate.

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of other sizes of gold nanoparticles. However, it is likely that the size of the nanoparticles can be controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions, such as the concentration of the gold precursor, the reaction temperature, and the reaction time."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 70 nm Pt3Ni nanoparticles (NPs). However, it does describe the synthesis of ultrathin PtNi nanowires (NWs), which might be similar. The synthesis of these PtNi NWs involves several steps and materials.

The materials used in the synthesis include Pt(acac)2 (20 mg), Ni(acac)2 (10 mg), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 75 mg), 4 mL oleylamine, and 10 mg of W(CO)6. These materials were added into a 30 mL vial. The resulting mixture was preheated in an oil bath and kept at 170°C for 5 minutes. Then, W(CO)6 was rapidly added into the solution to initiate the reaction, which was allowed to proceed for 2 hours. The product was collected by centrifugation and subsequently washed three times with ethanol and hexane (1:2, v/v). It was then transferred into a mixture solution containing 4 mL ethanol and 1 mL diethylamine for 24 hours, and then centrifuged. The final product was dispersed in ethanol for further use.

The synthesis of streptavidin modified ultrathin PtNi NWs (SA-PtNi) was also described. 100 µL of SA (1 mg mL-1) was added into 1 mL of PtNi NWs aqueous suspension (0.5 mg mL-1), and the mixed solution was shook gently for 12 hours at 4°C to make SA immobilize onto the PtNi NWs via the Pt-NH2 bond. The SA-PtNi was obtained by centrifugation and then washed with ultrapure water to remove the unbound SA. Finally, the SA-PtNi was redispersed in 500 µL Tris-Hcl buffer and stored at 4°C for further experiment.

The article also mentions the use of a UV-vis spectrophotometer for assessing the peroxidase-like activity of the ultrathin PtNi NWs. The steady-state kinetic assays were performed in time-course mode, and all measurements were monitored by the absorbance change at 652 nm. The kinetic parameters were calculated according to the typical Michaelis-Menten equation.

In conclusion, while the article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 70 nm Pt3Ni NPs, it does provide a detailed procedure for the synthesis of ultrathin PtNi NWs."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 70 nm Pt3Ni nanoparticles (NPs). However, it does describe the synthesis of ultrathin PtNi nanowires (NWs), which might be similar. 

The synthesis of ultrathin PtNi NWs was carried out with minor modifications from a previous method (Li et al., 2018a). The reagents used were Pt(acac)2 (20 mg), Ni(acac)2 (10 mg), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 75 mg), and 4 mL oleylamine. These were added into a 30 mL vial. The resulting mixture was preheated in an oil bath and kept at 170°C for 5 minutes. Subsequently, 10 mg of W(CO)6 was rapidly added into the above solution to initiate the reaction, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 hours. The product was collected by centrifugation and subsequently washed three times with ethanol and hexane (1:2, v/v). It was then transferred into a mixture solution containing 4 mL ethanol and 1 mL diethylamine for 24 hours, and then centrifuged. The final product was dispersed in ethanol for further use. The synthesis of Pt NWs followed a similar procedure, except for the absence of Ni precursors.

The synthesis of streptavidin modified ultrathin PtNi NWs (SA-PtNi) was also described. 100 µL of SA (1 mg mL-1) was added into 1 mL of PtNi NWs aqueous suspension (0.5 mg mL-1), and the mixed solution was gently shaken for 12 hours at 4°C to make SA immobilize onto the PtNi NWs via the Pt-NH2 bond (Cui et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018). The SA-PtNi was obtained by centrifugation and then washed with ultrapure water to remove the unbound SA. Finally, the SA-PtNi was redispersed in 500 µL Tris-Hcl buffer and stored at 4°C for further experiments.

The elemental mapping images of the prepared samples demonstrated that Pt and Ni were homogeneous throughout the whole structure. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the PtNi NWs showed a typical fcc structure and all characteristic diffraction peaks had a slight blue shift relative to the Pt NWs due to the coupling of partial Ni atoms (Zhang et al., 2019), further illustrating that the alloy structure was synthesized successfully. Moreover, as determined by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), the atomic ratio of Pt and Ni was proved to be about 2.99:1.00. 

Please note that the synthesis process described in the article is for ultrathin PtNi NWs, not for 70 nm Pt3Ni NPs. The size, shape, and composition of nanoparticles can be influenced by the synthesis conditions, and the article does not provide specific information on how to adjust these parameters to obtain 70 nm Pt3Ni NPs."

The synthesis of reduced Co3O4 nanoparticles (R-Co3O4) in this study is achieved through a step-by-step procedure using the metal-organic framework ZIF-67 as the precursor. The specific size of the nanoparticles is not mentioned in the article.

The first step involves the synthesis of ZIF-67. This is achieved using a simple one-step hydrothermal process. Specifically, 2-methylimidazole (1642 mg, 20.0 mmol) and Cobalt nitrate (III) hexahydrate [Co(NO3)3·6H2O] (1164 mg, 4.0 mmol) are separately dissolved in 100 mL of methanol. Both solutions are then mixed and stirred for 24 hours. The resulting violet precipitate is collected by filtration, washed thrice using ethanol, and dried overnight at 80 °C.

The as-prepared ZIF-67 is then used as a sacrificial precursor to prepare pristine Co3O4 (P-Co3O4). This is achieved by placing the ZIF-67 in a porcelain boat and heating it to 500 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 for 1 hour under an O2 atmosphere. The result is a black powder, P-Co3O4.

Finally, R-Co3O4 is obtained by soaking the P-Co3O4 powder in 100 mL of 1 M NaBH4 for 1 hour. The resulting product is R-Co3O4, which shows a remarkably enhanced peroxidase-like activity compared to P-Co3O4.

The characterization of the synthesized nanoparticles is performed using various techniques and equipment. The sample morphologies are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is conducted using a scanning X-ray microprobe (Thermo Scientific, ESCALAB 250Xi). The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra are obtained via JEOL JES-FA200 (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), and the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns are collected using a Bruker AXS D8 Advance instrument. The UV−vis spectra are obtained using the Persee TU-1901 UV−vis spectrophotometer. The N2 adsorption−desorption measurements are recorded using the ASAP-2020 surface area analyzer at 77 K. The specific surface areas and pore size distributions of the samples are calculated using the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) method and Barrett−Joyner−Halenda (BJH) model, respectively."

The as-prepared ZIF-67 was then used to prepare pristine Co3O4 (P-Co3O4) under an oxygen atmosphere at 500 °C. The SEM images show that the polyhedral morphology of ZIF-67 transforms into that of a coral-like nanocomposite after pyrolytic treatment, which is most likely due to the transformation of the organic ligands into carbonaceous materials.

Finally, the reduced Co3O4 nanocomposite (R-Co3O4) was obtained by soaking the P-Co3O4 powder in 100 mL of 1 M NaBH4 for 1 hour. The TEM and SEM images indicate that R-Co3O4 presents a morphology featuring flowerlike structures of uniform sizes and petal widths of ∼14 nm.

The characterization of the synthesized nanoparticles was performed using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), UV−vis spectra, and N2 adsorption−desorption measurements.

In conclusion, while the article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 300 nm Co3O4 nanoparticles, it does describe a method for synthesizing reduced Co3O4 nanoparticles using ZIF-67 as the precursor. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using various techniques to confirm their structure and composition."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 300 nm Co3O4 nanoparticles. However, it does describe a method for synthesizing reduced Co3O4 nanoparticles (R-Co3O4) using a step-by-step procedure with ZIF-67 as the precursor.

The synthesis of ZIF-67, which is used as a precursor for the Co3O4 nanoparticles, is performed using a simple one-step hydrothermal process. In this process, 2-methylimidazole (1642 mg, 20.0 mmol) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (1164 mg, 4.0 mmol) are separately dissolved in 100 mL of methanol. Both solutions are then mixed and stirred for 24 hours. The resulting violet precipitate is collected by filtration, washed three times with ethanol, and dried overnight at 80 °C.

The as-prepared ZIF-67 is then used to prepare pristine Co3O4 (P-Co3O4) under an oxygen atmosphere at 500 °C. The SEM images show that the polyhedral morphology of ZIF-67 transforms into that of a coral-like nanocomposite after pyrolytic treatment, which is most likely due to the transformation of the organic ligands into carbonaceous materials.

Finally, the reduced Co3O4 nanocomposite (R-Co3O4) is obtained by soaking the P-Co3O4 powder in 100 mL of 1 M NaBH4 for 1 hour. The TEM and SEM images indicate that R-Co3O4 presents a morphology featuring flower-like structures of uniform sizes and petal widths of approximately 14 nm.

In terms of characterization, the sample morphologies are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is conducted using a scanning X-ray microprobe (Thermo Scientific, ESCALAB 250Xi). The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra are obtained via JEOL JES-FA200 (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), and the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns are collected using a Bruker AXS D8 Advance instrument. The UV−vis spectra are obtained using the Persee TU-1901 UV−vis spectrophotometer. The N2 adsorption−desorption measurements are recorded using the ASAP-2020 surface area analyzer at 77 K. Furthermore, the specific surface areas and pore size distributions of the samples are calculated using the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) method and Barrett−Joyner−Halenda (BJH) model, respectively."

The synthesis of Au NPs (nanoparticles) was carried out using a liquid-phase reduction method. The reagent used was HAuCl43H2O (25 mM), which was diluted with 10 mL of deionized water. This solution was then heated to 100 C. Following this, 1 mL of trisodium citrate dihydrate (10 mg mL-1) was quickly added, which allowed for a 10-minute reaction. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was separated by centrifugation and redispersed in deionized water to form a dispersion (0.442 mg mL-1).

The morphology of the NPs was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 U-TWIN). The crystal structure of the NPs was determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 focus). The composition of the NPs was measured by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Thermo Scientific iCAP 6300). The surface analysis for NPs was completed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi). Zeta potential data was collected by a nanoparticle analyzer (Malvern zetasizer Nano ZS).

For the synthesis of Au@Ptx NPs, 1.0 mL of the above Au NP dispersion was diluted with 8 mL of deionized water, followed by the addition of the required volume of H2PtCl66H2O aqueous solution (20 mM) and 0.1 M of ascorbic acid (AA, AA/Pt4+ = 5). The mixture was heated at 80 C for 30 minutes with stirring. Finally, the product was separated by centrifugation, washed repeatedly, and redispersed in deionized water to obtain a dispersion.

The article does not specify the exact size of the Au NPs synthesized, but it mentions that the diameter of the NPs had a tendency to increase as the Pt/Au feed ratio increased. The Au@Pt3.15 NPs, for example, had an average diameter of about 25 nm. The size of the NPs can likely be controlled by adjusting the Pt/Au feed ratio and other parameters of the synthesis process."

Zeta potential data was collected by a nanoparticle analyzer (Malvern zetasizer Nano ZS). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were carried out at ambient temperature in a Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer (Billerica, MA).

The synthesis of Au@Ptx NPs was also described. Briefly, 1.0 mL of the above Au NP dispersion was diluted with 8 mL of deionized water, followed by the addition of the required volume of H2PtCl66H2O aqueous solution (20 mM) and 0.1 M of ascorbic acid (AA, AA/Pt4+ = 5). The mixture was heated at 80 C for 30 minutes with stirring. Finally, the product was separated by centrifugation, washed repeatedly, and redispersed in deionized water to obtain a dispersion.

The size of the nanoparticles was controlled by adjusting the feed of Pt precursors. By fixing the amount of Au seeds and simply adjusting the feed of Pt precursors, a series of Au@Ptx NPs (x = 1, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15) were synthesized, where x represents the molar ratio of Pt/Au. The diameter of the nanoparticles had a tendency to increase as the Pt/Au feed ratio increased. The larger feed ratio also resulted in more Pt content in the products, as determined by the composition analysis by ICP-OES."

The synthesis of Au@Pt nanoparticles (NPs) of approximately 25 nm in size is described in the article. The process involves several steps and requires specific reagents and equipment.

Firstly, Au NPs are synthesized. This is done by diluting 240 µL of HAuCl4·3H2O (25 mM) with 10 mL of deionized water, followed by heating to 100°C. Then, 1 mL of trisodium citrate dihydrate (10 mg mL−1) is quickly added, which allows for 10 min of reaction. After cooling down to room temperature, the product is separated by centrifugation and redispersed in deionized water to form a dispersion (0.442 mg mL−1).

The next step is the synthesis of Au@Pt NPs. Briefly, 1.0 mL of the above Au NP dispersion is diluted with 8 mL of deionized water, followed by the addition of the required volume of H2PtCl6·6H2O aqueous solution (20 mM) and 0.1 M of ascorbic acid (AA, AA/Pt4+ = 5). The mixture is heated at 80°C for 30 min with stirring. Finally, the product is separated by centrifugation, washed repeatedly, and redispersed in deionized water to obtain a dispersion.

The morphology of NPs is characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 U-TWIN). The crystal structure of NPs is determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 focus).

The surface analysis for NPs is completed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi). Zeta potential data is collected by a nanoparticle analyzer (Malvern zetasizer Nano ZS).

The synthetic methodology demonstrates advantages of rapidness, easy manipulation, as well as without employment of toxic agents/solvents and complex equipment. During the synthesis, by fixing the amount of Au seeds while simply adjusting the feed of Pt precursors, a series of Au@Pt NPs (x = 1, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15) were synthesized, where x represents the molar ratio of Pt/Au.

The synthesis of Au@Pt nanoparticles (NPs) of approximately 25 nm in size was described in the article. The process involved several steps and required specific reagents and equipment.

Firstly, Au NPs were prepared by the liquid-phase reduction of HAuCl43H2O by trisodium citrate dihydrate in boiling water. Specifically, 240 lL of HAuCl43H2O (25 mM) was diluted with 10 mL of deionized water, followed by heating to 100 C.

Firstly, monodispersed Pd NCs were initially synthesized and utilized as seeds according to the method published by the research group. For the 7.0 and 18.1 nm Pd NCs, the procedure consisted of 60 mg of AA, 105 mg of PVP, different amounts of KBr and KCl depending on the desired size (8 mg of KBr and 180 mg of KCl for 9.0 nm Pd NCs; 600 mg of KBr and 180 mg of KCl for 18.1 nm Pd NCs) all together in a vial and then it was pre-heated to 80 C for 10 min in an oil bath under magnetic stirring. Next, 3 mL of Na2PdCl4 aqueous solution with a concentration of 19 mg/mL was rapidly added. Lastly, the mixture was allowed to react for 3 h and then it was cooled down to room temperature to be washed three times and the final product was redispersed in 8 mL of deionized (DI) water for future use.

Secondly, in a standard synthesis of Pd-Pt core-shell NCs, the aqueous solution of K2PtCl4 as the Pt precursor was quickly injected into the mixture containing 40.3 nm Pd NCs as seeds, citric acid as reducing agent and poly (vinylpyrrolidone) (Mw  55,000) as surfactant, which was mixed under magnetic stirring and preheated to 95 C in a vial through the oil bath. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 h. After the successful deposition of Pt layers on the surface of the Pd NCs, they kept the overall cubic shape and increased the average edge length to 42.3 nm. The molar ratio of Pt to Pd was determined to be ~0.155 using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). 

The same procedure was followed to synthesize the 9.0 and 20.3 nm of Pd-Pt except for the use of different sizes of Pd seeds (7.0 and 18.1 nm) with a 3 mL K2PtCl4 solution with concentrations of 0.75 and 1.95 mg/mL, respectively. The size of the Pd-Pt core-shell NCs can be controlled by using Pd NCs of different sizes as seeds. 

The synthesized Pd-Pt NCs were characterized using a JEOL 1011 microscope operated at 200 kV for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, an Agilent Cary 60 UV-vis spectrophotometer for UV-vis spectra, a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer for X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns, and an Oakton pH 700 benchtop meter for pH value of the buffer solution. The Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, JY2000 Ultrace ICP atomic emission spectrometer equipped with a JYAS 421 autosampler and 2400 g/mm holographic grating) was used to determine the concentrations of Pd and Pt ions."

The synthesis of Pd-Pt core-shell nanocubes (NCs) of 9 nm or other sizes was achieved through a two-step seed-mediated growth process. The first step involved the synthesis of monodispersed Pd NCs, which were then used as seeds. The synthesis of the Pd NCs was achieved according to a method previously published by the research group. For the 7.0 and 18.1 nm Pd NCs, the procedure involved combining 60 mg of AA, 105 mg of PVP, different amounts of KBr and KCl depending on the desired size (8 mg of KBr and 180 mg of KCl for 9.0 nm Pd NCs; 600 mg of KBr and 180 mg of KCl for 18.1 nm Pd NCs) in a vial. This mixture was then pre-heated to 80 C for 10 min in an oil bath under magnetic stirring. Subsequently, 3 mL of Na2PdCl4 aqueous solution with a concentration of 19 mg/mL was rapidly added. The mixture was allowed to react for 3 h and then it was cooled down to room temperature, washed three times, and the final product was redispersed in 8 mL of deionized (DI) water for future use.

For the 40.3 nm Pd NCs, Pd NCs of 18.1 nm were used as seeds to mediate the growth into larger NCs. The procedure involved combining 90 mg of AA, 150 mg of PVP, 450 mg KBr and 0.72 mL of the previously synthesized Pd seeds in a flask. This mixture was then pre-heated to 40 C for 20 min in an oil bath under magnetic stirring. Subsequently, 5 mL of Na2PdCl4 aqueous solution with a concentration of 19 mg/mL was rapidly added. The mixture was allowed to react for 24 h and then it was cooled down to room temperature, washed three times, and the final product was redispersed in 5 mL of deionized (DI) water for future use.

The second step involved the synthesis of Pd-Pt NCs. After the synthesis of the Pd NCs, they were used as seeds to deposit a thin layer of Pt atoms as shell, following a previously reported method with minor modifications. The standard synthesis procedure consisted of 60 mg of citric acid, 35 mg of PVP and 5 mL of previously synthesized 40.3 nm Pd NC solution, dissolved in a total volume of 10 mL DI water in a glass vial. This mixture was then preheated to 95 C for 10 min under magnetic stirring. Subsequently, 3 mL of K2PtCl4 solution with a concentration of 4.33 mg/mL was rapidly added. The mixture was allowed to react for 24 h and then it was cooled down to room temperature, washed three times, and the final product was redispersed in 5 mL DI water. The same procedure was followed to synthesize the 9.0 and 20.3 nm of Pd-Pt except for the use of different sizes of Pd seeds (7.0 and 18.1 nm) with a 3 mL K2PtCl4 solution with concentrations of 0.75 and 1.95 mg/mL, respectively. 

The characterization and instrumentation used in the synthesis process included a JEOL 1011 microscope operated at 200 kV for taking the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, an Agilent Cary 60 UV-vis spectrophotometer for measuring the UV-vis spectra, a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer for recording the X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns, an Oakton pH 700 benchtop meter for measuring the pH value of the buffer solution, and an Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) for determining the concentrations of Pd and Pt ions."

The synthesis of irregular-shaped platinum nanoparticles (ISPtNP) of approximately 7 nm in size was carried out using a seed-growth method, with some modifications. The glassware used in the procedure was thoroughly cleaned in a bath of freshly prepared solution (1:3 HNO3–HCl), thoroughly rinsed with double-distilled water, and dried prior to use.

Initially, 100 mL of H2PtCl6 aqueous solution (0.234 mM) was added into a 250-mL round-bottom flask equipped with a condenser, and heated to 100 ◦C. Following that, 1.25 mL of trisodium citrate (38.8 mM) was introduced quickly into the boiling solution, and continuously stirred for 90 min at 750 rpm until the color of the mixture turned from pale yellow to black. The aim of this step is to form small-size platinum nanoparticles for the seed growth.

Afterwards, the mixture was cooled down to room temperature (RT), and 0.5 mL of H2PtCl6 solution (23.4 mM) and 0.625 mL of trisodium citrate (38.8 mM) were simultaneously added into the resulting mixture. Subsequently, the resultant mixture was heated again to 100 ◦C, and kept for 90 min under stirring. 

The obtained ISPtNP were finally confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Hitachi H-7650, Japan), and stored at 4 ◦C in a dark-colored glass bottle (C[Pt] ≈ 0.35 mM) when not in use. The TEM image of the newly prepared ISPtNP showed a homogeneous distribution with a mean length of ∼7.0 nm and a narrowing width from 2.0 to 5.0 nm along.

In summary, the synthesis of 7 nm platinum nanoparticles requires the use of a round-bottom flask, a condenser, and a transmission electron microscope. The reagents used include H2PtCl6 aqueous solution, trisodium citrate, and double-distilled water. The process involves heating, stirring, and cooling steps, and the final product is stored at 4 ◦C."

The synthesis of urchin-like Mn3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) involves several steps and requires specific reagents and equipment. The initial step involves dissolving 1.0 g of KMnO4 (6.3 mmol) in 500 mL of ultrapure water and stirring vigorously for 30 minutes. Following this, 20 mL of oleic acid (0.063 mmol) and 10mM of ammonium fluoride (NH4F) are added into the KMnO4 solution. The resulting mixed solution is then aged for 10 hours at room temperature.

After aging, the solution is placed in an ultrasonic bath and sonicated for one hour at a power of 5 W/cm2. The mixed solution is then stirred vigorously for 10 hours at 50 °C. The precipitate is washed with ultrapure water and then with ethanol to remove the unreacted starting materials. The washed precipitate is dried at 80 °C for 12 hours to obtain precursor granules. These granules are then calcined in air at 200 °C for 5 hours to obtain the urchin-like Mn3O4 particles.

The average diameter of the urchin-like Mn3O4 particles is about 700-800 nm. The growth time of the particles is a crucial factor in determining their size. When the growth time was 4 hours, the diameter of Mn3O4 nanoparticles was about 100 nm. When the growth time was extended to 12 hours, some nanoneedles, with the length of 20-30 nm, were grown irregularly on the surface of the Mn3O4 nanoparticles core. When the growth time continued from 18 hours to 24 hours, the urchin-like morphology was gradually formed. Therefore, the final growth time was determined to be 24 hours in this work.

The molar ratio of KMnO4 to oleic acid also influences the structure and morphology of the urchin-like Mn3O4 particles. When the molar ratio was 100: 1, the nanoneedles were grown vertically on the surface of urchin-like Mn3O4 particles. However, the urchin-like Mn3O4 particles began to agglomerate and stick when the ratio was not maintained.

The addition of NH4F plays an important role in the nucleation and growth of the nanoneedles. Without adding NH4F, the Mn3O4 particles were not the shape of urchin-like and the nanoneedles were arranged in disorder and grown randomly. Therefore, NH4F was identified to play an important role in nucleation and growth of the nanoneedles."

The synthesis of Pt/CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) is described in the manuscript. However, the manuscript does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 300 nm Pt/CeO2 NPs. The size of the Pt nanoparticles on the surface of CeO2 nanorods was reported to be 2.6 ± 0.4 nm. 

The CeO2 nanorods were prepared by a hydrothermal method. Briefly, 0.654 g Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was dissolved in 10 mL ultrapure water in a 50 mL round bottom flask. Then, 20 mL 10 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution was drop added into the flask under vigorous stir at room temperature. The white slurry was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-line stainless steel autoclave and held at 100°C for 24 hours. After hydrothermal treatment, the obtained CeO2 nanorods were washed with deionized water by centrifugation until the pH value of supernatant was 7. The precipitate was dried at 120°C for 12 hours in air to obtain yellow CeO2 nanorods powder.

For the preparation of Pt/CeO2 nanocomposites, 50 mg CeO2 powder was dispersed in 25 mL EG with ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. 250 µL NaOH EG solution (1 M) and 1 mL H2PtCl6·6H2O EG solution (30 mM) were both added into the above dispersion under vigorous stir. After 30 min stirring, the mixture was heated and held at 180°C for 2 hours with oil bath. The color of reaction solution changed from light yellow to grey indicating the formation of Pt nanoparticles. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature naturally, and the precipitate was centrifuged and washed for three times with ultrapure water. The obtained gray precipitate (Pt/CeO2) was re-dispersed into water for further use. The Pt/CeO2 nanocomposites with different Pt loading were prepared by changing the amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O.

The morphology and component of the prepared Pt/CeO2 nanocomposites were characterized using various techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and elemental mapping analysis were carried out on a transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai G2 F20, USA) operated at 200 kV. The samples for TEM analysis were prepared by depositing one droplet of ethanol dispersion of catalysts onto carbon-coated Cu-grids and dried in atmosphere. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was also used to characterize the morphology of Pt/CeO2 nanocomposites (Hitachi SEM-4800, Japan). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (D/MAX-TTRⅢ-CBO, Rigaku, Japan) with a scan rate of 4°/min over the 2θ range of 20°-60°. The samples for XRD patterns were prepared by dropping the dispersion of Pt/CeO2 nanocomposites onto silicon wafers and dried in air at room temperature to form films of catalysts. The chemical states of Pt/CeO2 nanocomposites were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an XPS spectrometer (ESCALAB 250X, ThermoFisher Scientific, UK). The concentrations of as-prepared catalysts were obtained by the inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Thermo Scientific, USA). The absorbance intensity and absorption spectra of reaction solution were evaluated by an EnVision Multimode Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, USA) at room temperature."

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 2700 nm or other size CoMn2O4/Mn2O3 nanoparticles. However, it does detail the synthesis of Co/Mn-BTC and mixed Mn/Co oxides, which could potentially be used to create nanoparticles of varying sizes.

The Co/Mn-BTC was synthesized with some modifications from the literature. Initially, 10 g of PVP (Mw=30,000) was dissolved in a 40 mL ethanol/water (1:1, v/v) mixture under stirring. Then, 1.125 mmol Mn(CH3COO)2∙4H2O and 0.375 mmol Co(CH3COO)2∙4H2O were added into the solution to form a pink transparent solution A. Subsequently, 2.15 mmol of BTC was dissolved into a 40 mL ethanol/water (1:1, v/v) mixture solution to form a colorless solution B. Solution B was then added to solution A slowly under vigorous stirring for 20 minutes. The final mixture was left at room temperature without interruption for one day. After centrifuge separation, the pale pink product was obtained and treated with C2H5OH several times. The product was then dried at 60 oC and was denoted as Co/Mn-BTC-0.33 (molar ratio of Co to Mn = 1:3) for convenience.

The synthesis of mixed Mn/Co oxides involved placing the Co/Mn-BTC-0.33 powders in a muffle furnace and annealing at 500 oC for 2 hours. The samples were then cooled naturally down to room temperature to obtain the final product named CMO-0.33. Other metal oxides products were obtained by the same calcination process, including Mn2O3, CMO-0.25, CMO-0.5, CMO-1.0 and Co3O4, corresponding to Mn-BTC, Co/Mn-BTC-0.25, Co/Mn-BTC-0.5, Co/Mn-BTC-1.0 and Co-BTC, respectively.

The morphologies and microstructures of precursor Co/Mn-BTC-0.33 and the calcined product CMO-0.33 were investigated by SEM and TEM. The atomic molar ratio of Mn/Co was found to be 10.6 : 1 by XPS analysis, which is basically consistent with the ICP-OES result (is 9.3 : 1), further confirming the existence of cobalt in CMO-0.33."

The synthesis of CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and Pr-modified CeO2 NPs was carried out following a specific procedure. The concentrations of Ce and Pr precursors were adjusted to Pr concentrations of 5, 10, 15 and 20mol.%. For example, 10%Pr-CeO2 NC was synthesized using a mixture of 0.094 M Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.01 M Pr(NO3)3·6H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%). The samples were then washed several times and once with ethanol (Panreac, Absolute Ethanol). Finally, the samples were dried at 80 oC for 24 h in an oven. A yellowish powder was obtained for CeO2 NPs, and a reddish powder was obtained for 10%Pr-CeO2 NPs.

Physical and Compositional Characterization of the samples was carried out using various techniques. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a D8 ADVANCE diffractometer of Bruker using the Cu Kα radiation, with a range of 5-110o, a step of 0.02o and a step time of 1s. The software DiffracPlus was used to measure the width of the {111} diffraction peak of ceria in order to calculate the particle size using the Scherrer equation. ICP measurements were carried out using an ICP-AES Iris Intrepid equipment of Thermal Elemental to determine the actual Pr content of the Pr-modified nanocubes. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of the samples were determined in a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 via nitrogen adsorption at -196 oC. Prior to the analysis, the samples were degasified at 150 oC for 2 h under vacuum.

The surface chemical composition in Ce and Pr of the samples was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The analyses were performed on the as-synthesized CeO2 NC and the other Pr-modified CeO2 NC, excluding the 20%Pr-CeO2 NC+NR sample. The edge lengths of CeO2 NC are mainly comprised in the range from 5 to 45 nm. Nanocubes larger than 50 nm are only observed in the Pr-modified ceria nanocubes, but with very small frequencies (less than 5%).

In summary, the maximum Pr concentration which could be incorporated into the ceria nanocube structure was up to 15mol.%. The chemical composition of the Pr-modified CeO2 NCs was determined at macroscopic level by ICP, with the molar concentrations of Pr determined being 4.4, 9.7, 14.4 and 19.2%, which are very close to the expected values. The Pr concentration of 10%Pr-CeO2 NC is very similar to the ICP results, which represent the average bulk composition of the sample.

The synthesis of Pr-modified CeO2 NC samples, including the 5%Pr-CeO2 NC (which can be interpreted as Pr0.05-CeO2), was carried out following the same procedure as CeO2 NC. The concentrations of Ce and Pr precursors were adjusted to Pr concentrations of 5, 10, 15 and 20mol.%. For example, 10%Pr-CeO2 NC was synthesized using a mixture of 0.094 M Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.01 M Pr(NO3)3·6H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%). At the end, a reddish 10%Pr-CeO2 NC powder was obtained. 

The physical and compositional characterization of the samples was carried out using various techniques. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a D8 ADVANCE diffractometer of Bruker using the Cu Kα radiation, with a range of 5-110o, a step of 0.02o and a step time of 1s. The software DiffracPlus was used to measure the width of the {111} diffraction peak of ceria in order to calculate the particle size using the Scherrer equation. ICP measurements were carried out using an ICP-AES Iris Intrepid equipment of Thermal Elemental to determine the actual Pr content of the Pr-modified nanocubes. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of the samples were determined in a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 via nitrogen adsorption at -196 oC. Prior to the analysis, the samples were degasified at 150 oC for 2 h under vacuum.

The surface chemical composition in Ce and Pr of the samples was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The edge lengths of CeO2 NC are mainly comprised in the range from 5 to 45 nm. Nanocubes larger than 50 nm are only observed in the Pr-modified ceria nanocubes, but with very small frequencies (less than 5%). It also should be highlighted that in the 5%Pr-CeO2 NC sample 30% of the nanocubes are smaller than 5 nm, which is not observed on the other two Pr-modified ceria NCs.

Element mapping was performed on the 10%Pr-CeO2 sample in order to investigate the homogeneity of this sample. It can be seen that Ce and Pr homogeneously distribute throughout a nanocube. The quantification of XEDS performed in areas 1 (black line) and 2 (solid grey) shows equivalent composition close to the nominal value 10mol.%Pr.

In summary, the maximum Pr concentration which could be incorporated into ceria maintaining a nanocube morphology was 15mol.%. At Pr concentrations equal or higher than 20mol.%, the hydrothermal synthesis led to a mixture of nanocubes and nanorods. Pr is homogeneously distributed within the nanocubes both at surface and bulk levels.

The synthesis of Pr-modified CeO2 nanocubes (NC) with different Pr concentrations was carried out following the same procedure as CeO2 NC.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 1700 nm or other size Mn0.6Co0.4O nanoparticles. The synthesis process described in the article involves the creation of porous MnxCo1-xO microspheres, but it does not specify the size of these microspheres or provide a method for controlling their size.

The synthesis of the MnxCo1-xO microspheres is described as a two-step process. The first step involves the preparation of Mn-Co Prussian blue analogues (PBA) with different Mn content. The second step involves annealing the resulting Mn-Co PBA precursor under air condition. The resulting product only shows peaks assigned to (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4, indicating the successful synthesis of Mn-Co oxide. The article does not provide specific details about the equipment or reagents used in this process, or the quantities involved.

The article also mentions that the pyrolysis temperature has an important effect on Mn-Co oxide composition, as well as the oxidase mimicking activity. The Mn-Co oxide obtained at 400 °C displays the higher catalytic activity than others. The specific surface area (SSA) of Mn-Co oxide achieved at 300, 400, 500 and 600 °C were determined to be 24.9, 31.4, 29.6 and 20.4 m2/g, respectively. Therefore, it is inferred that the higher catalytic activity of Mn0.6Co0.4O obtained at 400 °C was mainly ascribed to its larger SSA.

However, the article does not provide specific details on how to control the size of the resulting nanoparticles, or how to synthesize nanoparticles of a specific size such as 1700 nm."

The article does not provide specific instructions for synthesizing 500 nm Co(OH)2 nanoparticles. However, it does describe a method for creating Co(OH)2 nanocages, which may be similar in size. 

The synthesis of Co(OH)2 nanocages is performed using a template-assisted route based on Pearson’s hard and soft acid-base principle. The process begins with the synthesis of Cu2O nanocubes, which are then used as a template for the formation of the Co(OH)2 nanocages. 

The specific procedure involves adding 1.665 g of PVP (MW: 40,000) into an ethanol/water solution (1:1 by volume, 50 mL). This is followed by the addition of 0.025 g of cubic Cu2O templates and 0.0085 g of CoCl2·6H2O. The mixture is stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature, after which 20 mL of 0.6 M Na2S2O3 is added over a period of 20 seconds. The reaction is allowed to proceed for 3 minutes, during which the suspension changes color from red to emerald. The final products are then washed and stored in 10 mL of methanol.

The Co(OH)2 nanocages are then used in a kinetic experiment with TMB as a substrate. The experiment involves using 150 μM of Co(OH)2 with different concentrations of TMB (0.13, 0.67, 1.33, 2, 2.67, 3.33, and 4 mM).

The synthesis of boron nitride nanosheet and copper sulfide nanohybrids (BNNS@CuS) was carried out using a facile solvothermal approach. The materials used for the synthesis included boron nitride powder, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), Triton X-100, cholesterol, cholesterol oxidase (CHOx, 100UN) and cholesterol esterase (1KU) which were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Other reagents such as CuSO4, Na2S, cysteine, serine, histidine, uric acid, glucose, glycerin, phenol and ascorbic acid were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All the chemical reagents used were at least of analytical grade.

In a typical procedure, 0.5 g hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) powder was immersed in 500 mL N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), followed by high-power (700W) ultrasonication for 6 h. The upper milky white solution was poured out after sedimentation overnight. The BNNSs were collected by centrifuging the solution, and washed for three times with ethanol to remove NMP.

10 mg as-prepared BNNS was dispersed well in 25 mL purified water by ultrasonic treatment before the BNNS dispersion was stirred with 5 mL of 0.03 g/mL sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution for 1 h, and then 5 mL of 20 mM copper sulfate aqueous solution was added, followed by magnetic stirring under refluxing for 2 h. Subsequently, 2 mL of 60 mM sodium sulfide aqueous solution was dropped into the above pale blue suspension under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture continued to reflux for 15 min until a dark green dispersion was obtained. After natural cooling, the dark green precipitate was collected by centrifugation, rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and ethanol, and dried at 65 ◦C for 10 h in vacuum drying oven for characterization and further use.

The morphology of the synthesized nanohybrids was analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Zeiss, Jena, Thuringia, Germany). The average lateral size of BNNSs is approximately 200 nm. The BNNSs served as templates for the growth of nanosized CuS on their surface, and the size distribution of CuS is less than 30 nm. The dark parts are generally the overlapped sections of the BNNSs."

The synthesis of high-index {hk0} faceted platinum concave nanocubes (HIF-Pt-CNCs), which are a type of platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs), is described in the article. The HIF-Pt-CNCs were synthesized using a one-pot synthesis method. 

Initially, 400 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), 75 mg of glycine, and 2.0 mL of 20 mM hexachloroplatinic (IV) acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6) were mixed together with 6.0 mL water. The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature to obtain a homogeneous yellow solution. 

Following that, the yellow solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with a capacity of 20 mL. The sealed vessel was heated from room temperature to 200 °C in around 30 minutes and kept at this temperature for 6 hours before it was cooled to room temperature. 

After being washed with ethanol twice and water three times via centrifugation, the HIF-Pt-CNCs were stored in 8 mL of water for future use. The final Pt concentration was approximately 0.79 mg mL-1, and the particle concentration was approximately 7.62 × 1011 particles mL-1 or ~1.27 × 10-9 M. 

The average apex-to-apex diameter of the HIF-Pt-CNCs, determined by counting more than 200 nanoparticles, was approximately 43.9 nm. The nanoparticles displayed a uniform cubic shape with a yield above 90%, and appeared to have a concave feature under careful observation. 

The successful synthesis of HIF-Pt-CNCs was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SEM images showed that each face of the nanocubes was excavated by a square pyramid in the center, indicating the presence of a concave feature in the nanocubes. The TEM images further confirmed the formation of the concave cube structure in the nanoparticles. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of 43 nm Pt NPs (in this case, HIF-Pt-CNCs) involves the use of specific reagents (PVP, glycine, and H2PtCl6), specific equipment (a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, SEM, and TEM), and specific conditions (temperature, time, and washing steps)."

The final Pt concentration was ~0.79 mg mL-1 and the particle concentration was ~7.62 × 1011 particles mL-1 or ~1.27 × 10-9 M.

The synthesized HIF-Pt-CNCs were then characterized using various techniques. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken using a FEI TECNAI G2F20 microscope and a FEI Nova NanoSEM 230 microscope. The concentrations of Pt ions were determined using an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Perkin Elmer Optima 7000DV), which could be used to calculate the particle concentrations of Pt nanoparticles by coupling with their particle sizes and shapes. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis was performed using a Zetasizer Nano S90, Malvern, London, U.K. The UV-vis spectra were measured and the kinetic assays were implemented using a UV 1102 spectrophotometer, Shanghai Techcomp Co. Ltd., China. The UV-vis spectra of samples in microplates were recorded using a Tecan Infinite 200 PRO, TECAN, Switzerland.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 43 nm Pt NPs. However, the average apex-to-apex diameter of the HIF-Pt-CNCs determined by counting more than 200 nanoparticles was ~43.9 nm. This suggests that the described synthesis method could potentially be used to produce Pt NPs of around 43 nm in size, although the exact size may vary depending on the specific conditions of the synthesis."

The synthesis of Nickel-Platinum nanoparticles (Ni-Pt NPs) is described in the article. However, the synthesis of pure Platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) is also mentioned. In a standard synthesis of Ni−Pt NPs, Ni(II) acetate and Pt(II) acetylacetonate with the same molar amounts were coreduced by acetaldehyde in tetraethylene glycol. The atomic ratio of elemental Ni to Pt in the NPs was determined to be 49/51 (∼1:1) by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The size of the Ni−Pt NPs was measured to be 13.9 ± 2.4 nm by randomly analyzing 200 particles.

If no Ni precursor was added to the synthesis, pure Pt NPs of ∼14.6 ± 3.1 nm as final products were obtained. The article does not provide specific details on the amounts of reagents used or the exact procedure for the synthesis of pure Pt NPs. However, it can be inferred that the synthesis likely involves the reduction of a Pt precursor in a suitable solvent, possibly in the absence of a Ni precursor.

The article also mentions that NPs of different Ni/Pt atomic ratios could be obtained by simply varying the amounts of Ni and Pt precursors in a standard synthesis while keeping all other conditions unchanged. For example, NPs with Ni/Pt = 33/67 (Ni−Pt2 NPs) and 62/38 (Ni−Pt0.5 NPs) were obtained when the molar ratio of Ni and Pt precursors were changed from 1:1 in the standard synthesis to 1:2 and 2:1, respectively.

The synthesized NPs were characterized by electron microscopes and XRD. The sizes of Ni−Pt2 and Ni−Pt0.5 NPs were 12.7 ± 2.1 and 14.9 ± 2.2 nm, respectively. Both NPs had Ni-rich cores and Pt-rich shells, similar to that of Ni−Pt NPs. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis shows that Pt 4d and 4f peaks were clearly seen from all the three NPs of different Ni/Pt atomic ratios, while noticeable Ni signals could only be observed from Ni−Pt0.5 NPs. High-resolution XPS spectra indicates that Pt on the surface of all three NPs is primarily in the form of Pt(0).

In conclusion, the synthesis of Pt NPs or Ni-Pt NPs involves the reduction of Pt and Ni precursors in a suitable solvent, with the molar ratio of the precursors determining the atomic ratio of Ni to Pt in the resulting NPs. The synthesized NPs are then characterized using various techniques such as electron microscopy, XRD, and XPS."

The synthesis of Ni−Pt nanoparticles (NPs) with Ni-rich cores and Pt-rich shells is described in the article. In a standard synthesis of Ni−Pt NPs, Ni(II) acetate and Pt(II) acetylacetonate with the same molar amounts were coreduced by acetaldehyde in tetraethylene glycol. The atomic ratio of elemental Ni to Pt in the NPs was determined to be 49/51 (∼1:1) by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). 

The growth mechanism of these NPs was monitored at different stages during the synthesis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ICP-AES. Small nuclei of ∼1 nm and Pt/Ni = 4:96 were observed at the initial stage (180 °C), suggesting the preferential reduction of Ni precursor. Thereafter, coreduction of Ni and Pt precursors promoted the increase of particle size to ∼11.5 nm (at 220 °C), where the Pt/Ni ratio was increased to 13:87. A core−shell structure could be observed when reaction temperature had been elevated to 240 °C. The particle size (ca. 14 nm) and Pt/Ni ratio (ca. 50:50) became stable after the temperature reached 280 °C.

It should be emphasized that the NPs of different Ni/Pt atomic ratios could be obtained by simply varying the amounts of Ni and Pt precursors in a standard synthesis while keeping all other conditions unchanged. For example, NPs with Ni/Pt = 33/67 (Ni−Pt2 NPs) and 62/38 (Ni−Pt0.5 NPs) were obtained when the molar ratio of Ni and Pt precursors were changed from 1:1 in the standard synthesis to 1:2 and 2:1, respectively. If no Ni precursor was added to the synthesis, pure Pt NPs of ∼14.6 ± 3.1 nm as final products were obtained. 

The sizes of Ni−Pt2 and Ni−Pt0.5 NPs were 12.7 ± 2.1 and 14.9 ± 2.2 nm, respectively. Both NPs had Ni-rich cores and Pt-rich shells, similar to that of Ni−Pt NPs. Compared to Ni−Pt2 NPs, the Ni−Pt0.5 NPs had much thinner Pt-rich shells and a higher Ni content on the surface. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of Ni−Pt NPs involves the coreduction of Ni(II) acetate and Pt(II) acetylacetonate by acetaldehyde in tetraethylene glycol, with the growth of the NPs monitored using TEM and ICP-AES. The size and composition of the NPs can be controlled by adjusting the molar ratio of the Ni and Pt precursors and the reaction temperature."

The synthesis of Ni−Pt nanoparticles (NPs) with a size of approximately 13.9 nm was achieved through a standard synthesis process. In this process, Ni(II) acetate and Pt(II) acetylacetonate were used in equal molar amounts and were co-reduced by acetaldehyde in tetraethylene glycol.

The synthesis of amorphous Cu(OH)2 nanoparticles (NPs) is described in the Experimental Section of the article. The approach used was developed by the authors' group based on a previous strategy. The process involves reacting CuCl2 with NaBH4 in ethanol.

In the experiment, CuCl2·2H2O (17 mg), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with a molecular weight of 55,000 (130.5 mg), and ethanol (40 mL) were added into a 100 mL flat bottom flask one by one. After 10 minutes of ultrasonication and 30 minutes of stirring, 7.7 mg of NaBH4 were dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol and quickly added to the solution under vigorous stirring. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 72 hours.

After this time, the products were collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol three times. The resulting amorphous Cu(OH)2 nanoparticles were used as the starting materials in a top-down process to create Cu(OH)2 supercages (SCs).

The size of the nanoparticles was not explicitly stated in the article, but it was mentioned that the obtained SCs have a similar size with amorphous Cu(OH)2 NPs (200 nm ~250 nm). This suggests that the size of the nanoparticles synthesized could be in the range of 200 nm to 250 nm.

The article does not provide information on the mmols of the reagents used in the synthesis of the nanoparticles. The equipment used in the synthesis includes a flat bottom flask for the reaction, an ultrasonicator for the ultrasonication step, and a centrifuge for the collection of the products."

After 10 min ultrasonication and 30 min stirring, 7.7 mg NaBH4 were dissolved in 10 mL ethanol and quickly added to the solution under vigorous stirring. After 72h, the products were collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol three times. 

The synthesis of 3D Cu(OH)2 supercages was also described. In a typical experiment, amorphous Cu(OH)2 nanoparticles (9.7 mg) and PVP (molecular weight 1,300,000) (20 mg) were dispersed in 20 mL DI-water by ultrasonication for 15 min in a 100 mL flat bottom flask. The solution was vigorously stirred for 15 min. A copper-ammonia complex solution was prepared from 5 mL Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (24.16 mg) aqueous solution plus 15 mL NH3·H2O solution (400 µL NH3·H2O (29 %) plus 14.6 mL DI-water). Then, 20 mL of copper-ammonia complex solution were added to the above mixture of amorphous Cu(OH)2 nanoparticles in 1 minute and stirred for 10 minutes. The products were collected by centrifugation and washed with acetone and methanol three times.

Using the same strategy, Cu(OH)2 supercages were disassembled by the addition of 200 µL, 600 µL and 800 µL NH3·H2O (29 %) to form a solution of copper-ammonia complex. 

The size of the nanoparticles and supercages was determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The crystal phase of the hollow nanocages was determined to be orthorhombic Cu(OH)2 from the corresponding powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. The specific surface area of the supercages was measured to be 172 m2g-1 according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model and the data in Figure S3."

The method involves the use of poly(styrene-b-acrylic acid-b-ethylene glycol) (PS-b-PAA-b-PEG) triblock copolymer, which forms tri-functional micelles in the aqueous solution. The PS, PAA, and PEG blocks act as core, shell, and corona, respectively.

The effect of calcination temperature was investigated to determine the optimized condition for the fabrication of well-defined mesoporous iron oxide. The composition, morphology, and textural characteristics of the as-synthesized mesoporous iron oxide materials were characterized with various analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and nitrogen (N2) adsorption-desorption isotherms.

The peroxidase-like feature of the synthesized mesoporous iron oxide was used to develop a proof-of-concept glucose sensor, in which the enzymatic oxidation of glucose with glucose oxidase (GOx) was synergized with TMB/H2O2 catalytic reaction. The in-situ production of H2O2 from the former system was used in the latter for the oxidation of TMB in the presence of mesoporous iron oxides. This results in a blue-colored complex solution which facilitated the colorimetric detection.

However, the article does not provide specific details on the quantities of reagents used, the exact process of synthesis, or the size of the nanoparticles produced. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a detailed procedure for the synthesis of 39 nm Fe2O3 nanoparticles based on the information given in the article."

The article does not provide specific instructions for synthesizing 100 nm Co3O4/Rh0.125 nanoparticles. However, it does describe the synthesis of 2D Co3O4@Rh NC, which involves Rh nanoparticles with a diameter of 4-6 nm dispersed on the surface of 2D Co3O4 NS.

The target 2D Co3O4@Rh NC was constructed by one-pot surfactant-aided oxido-reduction. Concentrated CTAB solution with 55.0 mmol/L is apt to form bilayer CTAB micelles, onto whose surface lots of OH– groups hydrolyzed from NaBH4 were absorbed and then Co2+ in turn to form curly Co3O4 NS, due to the strong electrostatic interaction between OH– and Co2+. At the same time, Rh3+ would be reduced to be Rh nano particles by virtue of the higher oxidation potential of Rh3+/Rh0 than Co2+/Co0, which were evenly attracted onto the surface of curly Co3O4 NS.

To further illustrate the structure of 2D Co3O4@Rh NC, Co3O4 NS and Rh NPs were prepared according to the similar synthetic procedure under the same conditions except using 1.0 mmol (0.291 g) Co (NO3)2∙6H2O or 0.2 mmol (0.0418 g) RhCl3∙3H2O to replace the mixture of RhCl3∙3H2O and Co(NO3)2∙9H2O respectively.

The synthesized 2D Co3O4@Rh NC was characterized by TEM, HR-TEM, EDS, XRD and XPS. The TEM image of 2D Co3O4@Rh NC clearly demonstrates that the resultant Rh NPs with 4–6 nm in diameter are well dispersed on the surface of 2D Co3O4 NS. The corresponding high-resolution TEM images express two different lattice fringe spacings of 0.227 nm and 0.244 nm, attributed to Rh NPs and Co3O4 NS respectively. EDS image indicates the presence of Rh, Co and O elements in the resulting 2D Co3O4@Rh NC with 1:5 feed ratio of Rh to Co, which was further confirmed from X-ray photoelectron wide-angle spectra (XPS) with all the presence of Co, Rh, and O elements in 2D Co3O4@Rh NC.

In conclusion, while the article does not provide specific instructions for synthesizing 100 nm Co3O4/Rh0.125 nanoparticles, it does provide a detailed description of the synthesis and characterization of 2D Co3O4@Rh NC, which involves Rh nanoparticles with a diameter of 4-6 nm dispersed on the surface of 2D Co3O4 NS."

The article does not provide a detailed step-by-step procedure for the synthesis of 8 nm Pt nanoparticles (NPs). However, it does mention that the size of the PVP55-capped Pt cubes can be tuned by varying the amount of PVP55 added in the standard synthesis. Specifically, the sizes of PVP55-capped Pt cubes could be changed to 8.16 nm when 8 mg PVP55 was added to the reaction solution.

The synthesis of these Pt cubes involves the use of PVP55 as the stabilizer and ionic Br- (from KBr) as the capping agent for Pt{100}. The surface property of these Pt cubes is different from that of conventional CTAB/TTAB-capped Pt cubes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted to examine chemical ligands on the surface, which indicated the adsorption of PVP molecules on the surface. In addition, the Br 3p peak could also be seen, suggesting the presence of Br- ions on the surfaces.

The formation mechanism of the PVP55-capped Pt cubes was studied by taking aliquots of the reaction solution from a standard synthesis at different stages and examining them by TEM. In the initial stage of the reaction, nanoparticles with sizes of several nanometers were formed. As the reaction proceeded, the size of the nanoparticles increased and their shape evolved, eventually forming cubes of ~7 nm as the final products.

The PVP55-capped Pt cubes have several distinctive advantages over conventional CTAB/TTAB-capped Pt cubes. They can be synthesized in a short period, can be produced in large quantities, and their size can be tuned by simply varying the amount of PVP55 added in the standard synthesis. 

The peroxidase-like activity of the PVP55-capped Pt cubes was determined by the apparent steady-state kinetic assay, in which the oxidation of 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, a typical peroxidase substrate) by H2O2 was employed as a model catalytic reaction. All the kinetic assays were carried out at room temperature in cuvettes with a path length of 1.0 cm. UV-vis spectrophotometer was used for determining the concentration of colored products (i.e., oxidized TMB with λmax = 653 nm) and thereby the initial reaction velocities.

However, the article does not provide specific details about the quantities of reagents used (in mmols) or the exact equipment used for the synthesis of the Pt NPs."

For example, the sizes of PVP55-capped Pt cubes could be changed to 8.16 and 6.45 nm, respectively, when 8 and 200 mg PVP55 (instead of 40 mg PVP55) were added to the reaction solution. 

The article also mentions that the synthesis of these Pt NPs involves the use of PVP55 as the stabilizer and ionic Br- (from KBr) as the capping agent for Pt{100}. The surface property of these Pt cubes should be different from that of conventional CTAB/TTAB-capped Pt cubes. To examine chemical ligands on the surface, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted for the Pt cubes. The observation of peaks for O 1s, N 1s, Pt 4d, C 1s and Pt 4f indicated the adsorption of PVP molecules on the surface. In addition, the Br 3p peak could also be seen, suggesting the presence of Br- ions on the surfaces.

The formation mechanism of the PVP55-capped Pt cubes was studied by taking aliquots of the reaction solution from a standard synthesis at different stages and examining them by TEM. In the initial stage of the reaction, nanoparticles with sizes of several nanometers were formed. As the reaction proceeded, the size of the nanoparticles increased and their shape evolved from nearly truncated octahedral or cuboctahedral to anisotropically truncated cubes, and eventually to cubes of ~7 nm as the final products.

The article also mentions that the PVP55-capped Pt cubes have several distinctive advantages over conventional CTAB/TTAB-capped Pt cubes, including shorter synthesis time, larger production quantities, and tunable size. However, the exact quantities of the reagents used, the specific conditions of the reaction, and the equipment used for the synthesis are not provided in the article."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 4 nm Pt nanoparticles. However, it does describe the synthesis of PVP55-capped Pt cubes, which are a type of nanoparticle. The size of these nanoparticles can be tuned by varying the amount of PVP55 added in the standard synthesis. For example, the sizes of PVP55-capped Pt cubes could be changed to 8.16 and 6.45 nm, respectively, when 8 and 200 mg PVP55 (instead of 40 mg PVP55) were added to the reaction solution. 

In the synthesis of these PVP55-capped Pt cubes, Pt atoms from the reduction of precursor first nucleated and grew into truncated octahedra or cuboctahedra enclosed by both {100} and {111} facets. The selective binding of Br- ions to the {100} facets made these facets thermodynamically more stable than {111} facets. As a result, the addition of consequent Pt atoms preferentially occurred on {111} facets, resulting in the shrinkage of {111} facets and eventually the formation of Pt cubes mainly covered by {100} facets.

The article does not provide a detailed step-by-step procedure for the synthesis of Pt nanoparticles (NPs), but it does provide some information on the materials and methods used. 

The synthesis of Pt NPs, specifically PVP55-capped Pt cubes, was conducted using Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP55) as the stabilizer and ionic Br- (from KBr) as the capping agent for Pt{100}. In previous studies, Pt cubes were typically synthesized in the presence of cetyl￾trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) or tetradecyl￾trimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) as both the stabilizer and Pt{100} facet specific capping agent. However, in this work, the authors used PVP55 and ionic Br- instead, which resulted in a different surface property for the Pt cubes compared to conventional CTAB/TTAB￾capped Pt cubes.

To examine the chemical ligands on the surface of the Pt cubes, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted. The XPS analysis indicated the adsorption of PVP molecules on the surface. In addition, the Br 3p peak could also be seen, suggesting the presence of Br- ions on the surfaces. The existence of Pt(II) species on the surface can be ascribed to the chemisorption of Br- ions. 

The authors also carried out Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis for both the Pt cubes and pure PVP powder. The FTIR spectrum taken from the Pt cubes matched well with that of pure PVP powder, indicating the presence of pyrrolidone species on Pt surface. 

The formation mechanism of the PVP55-capped Pt cubes was studied by taking aliquots of the reaction solution at different stages and examining them by TEM.

The synthesis of Rhodium nanoparticles (RhNPs) was carried out according to the experimental procedure described in a previous work. The RhNPs were synthesized by reducing 0.25 mM of RhCl3·3H2O with 2.5 mM borohydride in the presence of 0.25 mM citrate ions as stabilizers and mixing for 10 min under stirring. 

The characterization of RhNPs was performed with Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Dynamic light scattering (DLS). AFM images were obtained in tapping mode with a Multimode Nanoscope 3D using Tap300G silicon cantilevers with a force constant of ≈20–75 N m−1 and tip radius < 10 nm. DLS measurements were performed on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument, using a red laser at 25 °C.

The AFM images show relatively uniform RhNPs without aggregates. Based on the topographical height profile (section analysis) the size of the particles lied between 4.0 and 8.0 nm with an average size of 6.5 nm (depth profile analysis) while the average hydrodynamic diameter of the particles, calculated by DLS, was equal to 9.2 nm. 

The concentration of RhNPs was calculated according to the method described previously assuming the complete reduction of RhCl3 and that each nanoparticle has a spherical shape with a uniform face centered cubic (fcc) structure. The molar concentration of RhNPs of 7 nm size was calculated to be 1.4 nmol L−1 which corresponds to 8.4 × 1011 nanoparticles per mL (nps mL−1) of solution. 

All reagents used were of analytical grade. L-Cysteine, glutamine (Gln), creatinine, uric acid, D(+)-glucose, glucose oxidase, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), bovine serum albumin (BSA), sodium borohydride, sodium acetate, glacial acetic acid and urea were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 63 nm Pd@Pt nanoparticles. However, it does describe the general procedure for the preparation of Pd@Pt bimetallic nanoplates. 

Pd nanosheets (Pd NSs) were first prepared according to a previously reported method. Pd(acac)2 (50.0 mg), PVP (160.0 mg) and TBAB (160 mg) were mixed together with DMF (10.0 mL) and water (2.0 mL) in a glass pressure vessel. The vessel was then charged with CO to 1 bar and heated from room temperature to 90 °C in 1 h, and then kept at 90 °C for another 3 h before being cooled to room temperature. The obtained dark blue products were precipitated by acetone, and purified by an ethanol−acetone mixture for further use.

For the preparation of Pd@Pt bimetallic nanoplates with different Pt/Pd ratios, a similar procedure was applied except that different mass of Pt(acac)2 (2 mg mL−1 in DMF) was used to replace AuPPh3Cl and the solution was left undisturbed at 100 °C for more than 12 h. The amounts of Pd, Au and Pt were also measured by ICP-MS (the mass ratios of Pt/Pd from a to e are 1.3:1, 2.9:1, 5:1, 8:1 and 12:1, respectively).

The article does not provide specific details on the size of the nanoparticles produced using this method, nor does it provide specific molar amounts for the reagents used. The equipment used in this process includes a glass pressure vessel, a heating device to control the temperature, and a centrifuge for the separation of the products. The reagents used include Pd(acac)2, PVP, TBAB, DMF, water, acetone, ethanol, and Pt(acac)2."

The article provides a detailed procedure for the preparation of Co3O4-MMT nanocomposites, but it does not specify the size of the Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) produced. However, it does mention that the Co3O4 nanoparticles with ca. 10-20 nm in size were dispersed well on the surface of MMT sheets.

The Co3O4-MMT nanocomposites were prepared as follows: Firstly, 0.3000g MMT was dissolved in 13mL alcohol aqueous solution (H2O2:C2H5OH=1:1) under stirring violently for 18h to form a homogeneous suspension. Secondly, 0.2910g of the Co(NO3)2 (1mmol) were added into the above suspension under vigorous stirring for another 2h. The resulting solution was assigned as solution A. 

Thirdly, 1.25 ml ammonium hydroxide was cautiously dropwise added into the solution A and stirred for 1h. Subsequently, the above solution was sealed in an autoclave and heated at 170℃ for 8h. Finally, the products were collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water for three times and subsequently ethanol, and then dried at 60 ℃ for 8 h in air.

The peroxidase-like activity of Co3O4-MMT nanocomposites was investigated via the results of catalytic oxidizing the substrate TMB by H2O2. In a typical procedure, 0.2 mL of TMB (1 mM) in sodium acetate buffer solution (pH=4.0) was dealt with different reaction systems, listed in Table 1. The total reaction volume was 2 mL. The absorption spectra of different experimental systems were measured by recording the absorption spectra in wavelength mode (500-800nm).

In order to determine the influence of the reaction time on the preparation of nanocomposites, experiments were carried out for different reaction times (2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 10h). The obtained nanocomposites were characterized by XRD and SEM. From the XRD patterns, it can be seen that Co3O4 nanoparticles have been formed after reaction for 2h. The diffraction peaks at 19.04°, 31.32°, 36.89°, and 44.87° agreed well with that of peak of Co3O4 (JCPDS card no.42-1467). Moreover, from the XRD data, it can be found that the longer the experimental time, the more the intensity of the peaks of Co3O4 nanoparticles. It can be found that when experiments have carried out for 8 h, the intensity of diffraction peaks of Co3O4 nanoparticles have reached maximum."

The synthesis of Cu2(OH)3Cl-CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) was achieved through a co-precipitation method in an aqueous solution. The reagents used for this process included cerium chloride (CeCl3 ·7H2O), copper chloride (CuCl2·2H2O), and ionic liquids of 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride. The molecular ratio of copper salt to cerium salt was maintained at a fixed constant ion concentration (2:1). The exact quantities of the reagents used were 0.4672 g of CeCl3 ·7H2O and 0.4276 g of CuCl2·2H2O, dissolved in 200 mL of distilled deionized water. Additionally, 2.3945 g of ionic liquids were rapidly added to the solution.

The solution was then heated to 95 °C under nitrogen in an oil bath while being stirred magnetically in a round bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser. After two hours, 50 mL of 90 mM hexamethylenetetramine was added to the solution drop by drop over a period of 30 minutes. The solution was further reacted for 5 hours with constant fluxing under nitrogen and magnetic stirring.

After the reaction was completed, the samples were separated by filtration and further washed with water. They were then naturally dried at room temperature and stored until use. When needed, the material was redispersed in water.

The equipment used in this process included a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for recording, a JSM-6610 scanning electron microscope (Japan) for imaging, a Rigaku DLMAX-2550 V diffract meter for collecting X-ray powder diffract meter (XRD) data, a UV-2450 Shimadzu Vis-spectrometer for kinetic measurements and UV–vis absorption spectra, a Canon G11 digital camera for taking photographs, a Guohua SHA-C constant-temperature shaker, and a Jingli Ld4-2 low-speed centrifuge.

It's important to note that the article does not specify the size of the nanoparticles synthesized. Therefore, adjustments may be needed in the synthesis process to achieve 1000 nm Cu2(OH)3Cl-CeO2 NPs."

The synthesis of Cu2(OH)3Cl-CeO2 composite material, which includes nanoparticles, was achieved through a co-precipitation method in an aqueous solution. The reagents used for this process were cerium chloride (CeCl3 ·7H2O), copper chloride (CuCl2·2H2O), and ionic liquids of 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride. All reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. The molecular ratio of copper salt to cerium salt was at a fixed constant ion concentration (2:1). Specifically, 0.4672 g of CeCl3 ·7H2O and 0.4276 g of CuCl2·2H2O were dissolved in 200 mL distilled deionized water.

The solution was then brought to oil bath heating at 95 °C while magnetic stirring in a round bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser, and 2.3945 g of ionic liquids were rapidly added to the solution. The solution was heated to 95 °C under nitrogen. Two hours later, 50 mL 90 mM hexamethylenetetramine was added to the solution drop by drop over a period of 30 min. The solution was additionally reacted for 5 h with constant fluxing under nitrogen and magnetic stirring.

After the reaction was completed, the samples were separated by filtration and further washed with water. They were then naturally dried at room temperature. The final product was a very fine green powder that could be well dispersed in water. The material was stored at room temperature and redispersed in water when used.

The morphology, shape, and size of the samples were characterized by a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The phase and structures of the as-prepared powders were characterized by X-ray powder diffract meter (XRD). The SEM images indicated that the spheres with a diameter of about 0.8 μm were adhered to the large crystals with a diameter of 5–10 μm. The XRD data showed that all the diffraction peaks of the powders matched well with the Cu2(OH)3Cl Phase and cerium oxide Phase, indicating the formation of a pure Cu2(OH)3Cl-CeO2 composite material.

The synthesis of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) was carried out using several procedures. First, oleic acid-stabilized MNPs were synthesized using thermal decomposition of Fe-oleate in high-boiling-point solvents using procedures developed by Hyeon and co-workers [19]. The exact size of the nanoparticles is not specified in the article.

Two different approaches were applied to disperse oleic acid-stabilized MNPs in aqueous media. The first is cap exchange by poly(ethylene glycol)-derivatized phosphine oxide (POPEG), which has a PEG segment and a surface-coordinating phosphine oxide head group, for displacing the oleic acid on the nanoparticles. Briefly, 10 mg of nanoparticles were dispersed in 3 mL of THF solution containing 50 mg of POPEG. After removing THF by evacuation, the sticky mixture was incubated at 80 °C under a vacuum for 3 h. DI water was added, and the dispersed nanoparticles were purified by syringe and centrifugal filters. The MNPs obtained in this manner were denoted as POPEG-MNPs.

The other approach was the preparation by encapsulation via a hydrophobic interaction between alkyl chains in Lipid PEG and oleic acid on the nanoparticles. Here, 10 mg of oleic acid-stabilized MNPs were dispersed in 2 mL of chloroform. Then, it was mixed with 1 mL of chloroform solution containing 10 mg of mPEG-2000 PE. After evaporating the solvent, it was incubated at 80 °C in a vacuum for 1 h. After the addition of DI water, Lipid PEG-stabilized MNPs were purified by filtration and ultra-speed centrifugation. The MNPs obtained in this manner were denoted as Lipid PEG-MNPs.

Bare MNPs with the hydroxyl group were synthesized using the reported procedure [20]. Briefly, a 1 M sodium hydroxide solution was added to a 0.25 M Fe3+ and Fe2+ aqueous salt solutions (2:1 M ratio) while stirring at 80 °C for 40 min (pH 10). The MNPs obtained in this manner were washed several times with water and ethanol and dried at 70 °C under a vacuum. 

MNPs modified with APTES (APTES-MNPs) were synthesized using the procedures reported by Gao et al. [21]. The MNPs were dispersed in water to make a 10 mg·mL−1 stock solution and stored at 4 °C until use. 

The synthesized MNPs were analyzed by transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images on a Jeol EM-2010 microscope (Jeol Co.). The hydrodynamic diameters (HDs) of MNPs were determined by light-scattering analysis using a Zetasizer Nano-ZS (Malvern Co.). Iron concentrations in MNPs were also measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (model: Polyscan 60E, Thermo Jarrell)."

The synthesis of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is described in the article. The MNPs were prepared using two different water-dispersing methods, ligand exchange with poly(ethylene glycol)-derivatized phosphine oxide (POPEG) ligands and encapsulation by PEG-phospholipid shell (Lipid PEG).

After evaporating the solvent, it was incubated at 80 °C in a vacuum for 1 h. After the addition of DI water, Lipid PEG-stabilized MNPs were purified by filtration and ultra-speed centrifugation. The resulting MNPs were denoted as Lipid PEG-MNPs.

After synthesis, the resulting POPEG-MNPs and Lipid PEG-MNPs were re-dispersed in water to create a stock solution with a total Fe concentration of 2.67 mg·mL−1 and 1.91 mg·mL−1, respectively, and stored at 4 °C for use.

In addition to these methods, bare MNPs with the hydroxyl group were synthesized using a reported procedure [20]. Briefly, a 1 M sodium hydroxide solution was added to a 0.25 M Fe3+ and Fe2+ aqueous salt solutions (2:1 M ratio) while stirring at 80 °C for 40 min (pH 10). The MNPs obtained in this manner were washed several times with water and ethanol and dried at 70 °C under a vacuum. 

MNPs modified with APTES (APTES-MNPs) were synthesized using the procedures reported by Gao et al. [21]. The MNPs were dispersed in water to make a 10 mg·mL−1 stock solution and stored at 4 °C until use. 

The synthesized MNPs were analyzed by transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images on a Jeol EM-2010 microscope (Jeol Co.). The hydrodynamic diameters (HDs) of MNPs were determined by light-scattering analysis using a Zetasizer Nano-ZS (Malvern Co.). Iron concentrations in MNPs were also measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (model: Polyscan 60E, Thermo Jarrell)."

The synthesis of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) was carried out using several methods as described in the article. 

Firstly, oleic acid-stabilized MNPs were synthesized using thermal decomposition of Fe-oleate in high-boiling-point solvents using procedures developed by Hyeon and co-workers [19]. The exact size of the nanoparticles is not specified in the article, but this method is known to produce monodisperse nanoparticles.

Two different approaches were then applied to disperse these oleic acid-stabilized MNPs in aqueous media. The first approach involved a cap exchange by poly(ethylene glycol)-derivatized phosphine oxide (POPEG), which has a PEG segment and a surface-coordinating phosphine oxide head group, for displacing the oleic acid on the nanoparticles. Briefly, 10 mg of nanoparticles were dispersed in 3 mL of THF solution containing 50 mg of POPEG. After removing THF by evacuation, the sticky mixture was incubated at 80 °C under a vacuum for 3 h. DI water was added, and the dispersed nanoparticles were purified by syringe and centrifugal filters. The resulting MNPs were denoted as POPEG-MNPs.

The second approach involved the preparation by encapsulation via a hydrophobic interaction between alkyl chains in Lipid PEG and oleic acid on the nanoparticles. Here, 10 mg of oleic acid-stabilized MNPs were dispersed in 2 mL of chloroform. Then, it was mixed with 1 mL of chloroform solution containing 10 mg of mPEG-2000 PE.

The synthesis of RuTe nanoparticles (NPs) involves two main steps: the preparation of Te nanorods (TeNRs) and the synthesis of Ru-Te nanorods.

For the preparation of TeNRs, a 50 mL transparent borosilicate glass vial is used. To this vial, 1g of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) with a molecular weight of 40 kDa, 92.2 mg of sodium tellurite (Na2TeO3), and 0.5 mg of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) are added to 40 mL of ethylene glycol. This mixture is stirred to create a homogeneous solution without the need for ultrasonication. Then, 1.3 mL of hydrazine monohydrate (64-65%) is added. The mixture is heated in a 70 °C water bath for 3 hours under vigorous stirring. The resulting deep-blue colored TeNRs are cooled down to room temperature naturally and are used in the following reaction without any purification and storage.

The synthesis of Ru-Te nanorods is carried out in a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave vessel. To this vessel, 20 mL of the as-synthesized TeNRs in ethylene glycol and 2.5 mL of a 10 mM ruthenium(III) chloride (RuCl3) stock solution are added. After gentle mixing to ensure a homogeneous mixture, the Teflon-lined autoclave in a stainless steel reactor is heated at 200 °C for 2 hours. The resulting black colored product is cooled down to room temperature and purified by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 10 minutes. Additional washing steps with deionized (DI) water are performed at least 3 times and the product is finally re-dispersed in 20 mL DI water.

The morphology and size of the nanoparticles are observed using an energy-filtering transmission electron microscope (LIBRA 120, Carl Zeiss, Germany). High-resolution imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping are performed by a Cs-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. According to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, hollow nanorods with lengths of 130 ± 13 nm and widths of 14 ± 2 nm (n = 30) are synthesized with a relatively monodisperse distribution.

The colloidal stability of the particles is confirmed using simulated physiological fluid and their biocompatibility is confirmed using cyto-, hemo- and organ-toxicity analyses. This study serves as a basis for future material chemistry and biomedical research on the formation of Ru-based nanocomposites that exhibit multi-nanozymatic activity and high surface-to-volume ratios."

The synthesis of Cu2-xTe nanoparticles (NPs) is described in the research article. The Cu2-xTe NPs were synthesized via the reaction of copper(I) chloride with trioctylphosphine telluride (TOPTe). The as-prepared Cu2-xTe NPs are hydrophobic with oleic acid as surface ligands. 

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal that the Cu2-xTe NPs are typical cuboid structure with average dimensions of 17 nm × 11 nm × 9 nm. Element mapping results demonstrate the uniform distributions of Cu and Te in Cu2-xTe NPs. The electron diffraction pattern and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data show that the Cu2−xTe NPs are polycrystalline rickardite. The distance between adjacent lattice fringes is around 0.38 nm, corresponding to the (051) plane of Cu2−xTe. 

According to the energy dispersive spectrum (EDS), the atomic ratio of Cu to Te in Cu2−xTe NPs is close to 1.2:1, indicative of their nonstoichiometric composition. The elemental compositions and purity of Cu2-xTe NPs were further checked through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Characteristic binding energy peaks of both Cu(I) and Cu (II) can be clearly observed.

To increase the dispersion stability of Cu2-xTe NPs in physiological environment, 1, 2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-poly(ethylene glycol) (DSPE-PEG) was coated at the surface of Cu2-xTe NPs. The obtained Cu2-xTe NEs exhibit characteristic infrared absorption of DSPE-PEG in the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum, demonstrating their successful coating. 

The average hydrodynamic diameter of Cu2-xTe NEs is around 30 nm, which show similar morphology to Cu2-xTe NPs. The steric hindrance and hydrophilicity of DSPE-PEG endow Cu2-xTe NEs with stable dispersion stability in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for over two weeks; whereas Cu2-xTe NPs are prone to form aggregation with micrometer size under the same condition.

Unfortunately, the article does not provide specific details on the quantities of reagents used or the exact parameters of the synthesis process."

The synthesis of CuO nanoparticles (NPs) of around 200 nm size involves a series of steps and requires specific reagents and equipment. The process begins with the addition of 12 mL of water into 25 mL of an aqueous solution of PAN (0.05 g/mL) with continuous stirring. Following this, 0.16 g of PVP and 2.5 mL of ammonium hydroxide are added to the mixture. The mixture is then stirred magnetically for 20 minutes, after which 17.5 mL of sodium hydroxide solution (1.0 M) is added. The mixture is then stirred continuously for 2 hours at 60 °C and then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 minutes. The obtained precipitate is washed with ethanol three times and dried at 50 °C for 12 hours. The final product is pure and clear brown-colored PAN-CuO nanoflowers, which are stored at 4 °C for further use.

The growth mechanism of PAN-CuO nanoflowers was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). When the reaction time was 10 minutes, the CuO nanoneedles began to grow onto the surface of PAN nanoflowers, and the size of PAN-CuO nanoflowers was about ∼200 nm. As the reaction progressed, the average size of PAN-CuO nanoflowers reached ∼280 nm within 120 minutes and tended to be uniform. More and more CuO nanoneedles were grown onto the surface of PAN-CuO nanoflowers. When the reaction time was increased to 150 minutes, the size distribution (300−340 nm) and the morphology of the nanostructures were not uniform.

The effects of temperature and the amount of copper nitrate on the formation of nanostructures were also determined. When the temperature was 40 °C, very little CuO nanoneedles were grown on the surface of PAN nanoflowers. When the temperature was increased to 50 °C, flowerlike nanoparticles began to appear in some areas. When the temperature reached 60 °C, uniform nanoflowers (about 300 nm) were obtained. When the temperature was increased to 70 °C, the sample consisted of CuO nanorods and PAN. Therefore, 60 °C was chosen in the next experiment.

The effect of mass ratio of copper nitrate and PAN on the morphology of PAN-CuO nanoflowers was investigated. When the mass ratio of copper nitrate and PAN was 1.25:1, CuO nanoneedles were formed and tended to aggregate together rather than growing onto the surface of the PAN nanoflowers. When the ratio was reduced to 1:1, small amounts of CuO nanoneedles were grown on the surface of PAN, and when the ratio reached 1:1.25, flowerlike nanoballs were formed (about 300 nm). As the ratio reached 1:1.5, the sample still contained uniform nanoflowers. However, the diameter increased to 350 nm. Thus, the best ratio of copper nitrate and PAN was 1:1.25.

The influence of pH on the formation of PAN-CuO nanoflowers was also studied. When ammonium hydroxide was added into the reaction system, CuO nanoneedles could grow on the surface of PAN nanoflowers in an orderly manner, and the PAN-CuO nanoflowers formed gradually (about 300 nm). On the contrary, when ammonium hydroxide was not added into the system, large particles of CuO were formed, which did not grow on the surface of PAN nanoflowers but scattered on the side. Thus, after the addition of ammonium hydroxide in the reaction system, pure PAN-CuO nanoflowers were prepared."

The synthesis of PAN-CuO nanoflowers, which includes CuO nanoparticles, involves several steps and a variety of reagents and equipment. Initially, 12 mL of water was used. This was added into 25 mL of an aqueous solution of PAN (0.05 g/mL) with continuous stirring. The stirring was done using a magnetic stirrer. After this, 0.16 g of PVP and 2.5 mL of ammonium hydroxide were added to the mixture. 

The mixture was then stirred continuously for 20 minutes, after which 17.5 mL of sodium hydroxide solution (1.0 M) was added. The stirring continued for 2 hours at 60 °C. The mixture was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 minutes. The centrifugation was done using a centrifuge machine. The obtained precipitate was washed with ethanol three times and dried at 50 °C for 12 hours. 

The growth mechanism of PAN-CuO nanoflowers was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The size of PAN-CuO nanoflowers was about ∼200 nm when the reaction time was 10 min.

In conclusion, the synthesis of CuO nanoparticles involves a variety of parameters including the amount of reagents, temperature, pH, and reaction time. The optimal conditions for the synthesis were found to be a reaction time of 120 min, a temperature of 60 °C, and a mass ratio of copper nitrate to PAN of 1:1.25."

The materials used for the synthesis included citric acid (CA), rhodium(III) chloride hydrate (RhCl3·xH2O), chloroplatinic acid hydrate (H2PtCl6·xH2O), and sodium borohydride (NaBH4). These were obtained from various suppliers including Sigma-Aldrich, Samchun Chemical Co., Ltd, Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd, and Alfa Aesar.

The process began with the addition of 1 mL of H2PtCl6 (10 mM) and the same amount of RhCl3 (10 mM) to deionized (DI) water (16 mL). The mixture was incubated for 10 min under vigorous stirring. Then, 2 mL of CA (10 mM) was added. After incubation for 10 min, 1 mL of NaBH4 (60 mM) was quickly added under continuous stirring. The mixture was incubated for 30 min and centrifuged (13 000 rpm, 25 min) to precipitate the CA-RhPt NPs. Then, the precipitate was washed with ethanol and water. Finally, the precipitate was redispersed in DI water and stored at 4 °C before use.

The morphology and structure of the nanoparticles were confirmed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010, USA) and an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D/MAX-2500, Rigaku, USA), respectively. The introduction of CA to RhPt NPs was investigated using zeta potential measurements (zeta-potential analyzer, Zetasizer Nano ZS90, Malvern Instruments Ltd., U.K.) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-ALPHA, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., U.K.). 

The crystalline sizes of RhPt NPs and CA-RhPt NPs, which correspond to the peak of the (111) plane, were calculated using Scherer’s formula and estimated to be 3.30 and 2.90 nm, respectively. The reduced crystalline size of CA-RhPt NPs was due to the high dispersity of nanoparticles. The TEM image shows that the CA-RhPt NPs are well-dispersed with an average diameter of 3.5 ± 0.5 nm. 

In conclusion, the synthesis of RhPt NPs involves a simple one-pot wet chemical method using specific reagents and equipment. The size of the nanoparticles can be controlled by adjusting the parameters of the experiment, such as the concentration of the reagents and the incubation and centrifugation times."

The synthesis of citrate-capped platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) of approximately 2.5 nm in size is described in the article. The process involves the use of several reagents and equipment, and follows a specific procedure.

The reagents used in the synthesis include H2PtCl6·(H2O)6, trisodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7·2H2O), and sodium borohydride (NaBH4), all of which were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). Other reagents and chemicals used were of at least analytical reagent grade and used without further purification. Solutions were prepared with water purified by a Milli-Q purification system (Millipore, USA).

The synthesis of PtNPs was performed in a glass ware with the magnetic stir. Aqueous solutions of H2PtCl6 (1 mL, 16 mM) and trisodium citrate (1 mL, 40 mM) were mixed with 38 mL water and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, NaBH4 (200 µL, 50 mM) was added dropwise into the mixture. The colorless reactant mixture immediately turned into brownish yellow. Finally, the mixture was allowed to react and stirred at ambient temperature for 1 h.

The size and morphology of the nanoparticles was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The platinum nanoparticles were largely monodispersed and roughly spherical. The average particle diameter is found to be approximately 2.5±0.4 nm. High-resolution TEM indicates the continuous lattice spacing of 0.223 nm corresponding to the (111) facet of the face-centered cubic (fcc) Pt crystal.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed for the surface elemental analysis. The whole spectrum clearly revealed that platinum, carbon, oxygen, and sodium were present at the surface of PtNPs, indicating that the PtNPs are capped by citrate. The Pt 4f7/2 of citrate-capped PtNPs could be deconvoluted into two distinct components centered at binding energies of 72.82 and 74.71 eV, which could be assigned to Pt0 and Pt4+, respectively.

In conclusion, the synthesis of PtNPs involves the use of specific reagents, equipment, and procedures. The resulting nanoparticles are approximately 2.5 nm in size and are capped by citrate."

The synthesis of Fe-doped CoO nanoparticles (NCs), specifically 0.15Fe-CoO NCs, was achieved through a two-step process involving solvothermal and roasting processes. 

In the first step, 1 mmol of Co(NO3)2 was added into a homogeneous mixture containing glycerin and isopropanol (16 and 60 mL, respectively) and vigorously stirred for 1 hour. Following this, n mmol of Fe(NO3)3 (n = 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0) was added and continuously mixed for another 10 hours. The mixture was then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon container with a stainless-steel autoclave and treated under 180 °C for 6 hours. The obtained precipitate was purified by alternately washing with water and ethanol (6 times in total) and then dried overnight at 60 °C.

In the second step, the precursor was roasted at 400 °C for 2 hours with the protection of N2 flow. The final samples were recorded as nFe-CoO NCs. Pure CoO nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared using a similar method without adding Fe3+ salt. However, without Co2+ salt, the Fe3+ ions cannot crystallize to be FeO or Fe3O4 NPs.

The article does not provide specific information on the synthesis of 450 nm Fe0.15-CoO NPs.

The article does not specify the size of the nanoparticles produced, but it does mention that the doping of Fe not only reduced the average particle size of 0.15Fe-CoO NCs but also made the particles dense.

The synthesis of H2TCPP functionalized hydrophilic magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) was carried out using a simple one-step method. The reagents used in the synthesis included 5 mg of H2TCPP, which was dissolved in a dilute basic aqueous solution tuned by NaOH. About 0.1 mg of NaOH was dissolved in 1 mL of water to achieve a pH of 8. Following this, 16 mg of NaOH and 1.7 g of NaNO3 were dissolved in 19 mL of water, and the above porphyrin solution was added. Finally, a solution of FeSO4·7H2O (1 mL, 0.2 M) was rapidly added.

The characterization of the nanoparticles was performed using various techniques. The crystal structures of the products were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (D/Max2500PC, Rigaku). The dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement of the nanoparticles was performed on a Malvern particle size analyzer (Malvern, UK). Zeta potential was obtained on an electrophoresis apparatus (JS94H, China). The morphologies of the as-prepared H2TCPP-γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were investigated by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, Japan). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a NICOLET 380 FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet Thermo, USA) by detecting the compressed pellet obtained by mixing the sample with KBr. Absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-3200PC) (Shanghai, China). Fluorometric measurements were carried out by a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorophotometer (Varian, Inc., USA). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a PHI Quantera SXM spectrometer with an Al Kα=280.00 eV excitation source, and binding energies were calibrated by referencing the C1 speak (284.5eV) to reduce the sample charge effect.

The SEM images of the H2TCPP-γ-Fe2O3 NPs showed that the products are composed of a large quantity of nanospheres with a diameter range from ca. 20 nm to ca. 200 nm. The average size of the nanoparticles was ca.122.4 nm. The DLS measurements were carried out to investigate the distribution of these regular nanospheres. The obtained H2TCPP-γ-Fe2O3 NPs could be stably dispersed in aqueous solution, as shown in Fig. 4A. The stability of the nanocomposites in the aqueous solution was verified by zeta potentials (-55.403 mV). The high value of zeta potentials indicated the good stability of the nanocomposites in water."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 35 nm Fe2O3 nanoparticles. However, it does describe a general method for the synthesis of morphologically different iron oxide nanoparticles using Schiff base (SB) templates. 

The synthesis process involves the use of four different SBs, generated from the permutative combination of two different aldehydes (glyoxal and glutaraldehyde) and two different amines (ethylenediamine and triethylenetetramine). These SBs serve as templates for the synthesis of the iron oxide nanoparticles. Mohr’s salt is used as the iron source and hydrazine is used as the hydrolyzing reagent. The reaction is carried out at a refluxing temperature of 373 K. Under these conditions, morphologically different Fe2O3 nanoparticles are produced in 1 hour as a consequence of dehydration.

The refluxing condition for an hour and the N2 bubble formed from the decomposition of hydrazine effects the crystallisation process by formation of a large number of nucleation sites in the reaction medium. This facile synthesis leads to gram level production of phase pure crystalline γ-Fe2O3 or α-Fe2O3, depending upon the variable SB templates' nature. Oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ is a spontaneous process in the ambient condition. Considering Mohr’s salt as precursor, the transformation of Fe2+ ions is controlled, which further act as catalyst showing peroxidase-like activity. The effect of SB templates in the phase specific formation of Fe2O3 has been elaborated here. Advantageous imine group in SBs accelerates the hydrolysis of the metal hydroxide. This supports the benefit of SB template for the synthesis of Fe2O3 nanoparticles under refluxing condition.

The article also discusses the magnetic properties of the synthesized nanoparticles. As the particle size decreases to nanoregime, tinier than the magnetic domain; nanoparticles are considered to be completely magnetised. The term “superparamagnetism” is used to emphasis the magnetic behaviour for paramagnetic nanoparticles which arises from the coupling of several thousands of atoms in comparison to the paramagnetism of a single atom. This magnetization can reach nearly the saturation magnetization of ferromagnetic iron oxide, but in contrast to ferromagnetic iron the particles no longer show magnetic interactions after elimination of the magnetic field. The magnetic data of all these TemFes are examined and discussed thoroughly to decipher the linear relationship between the particle size and size dependent magnetism. 

In conclusion, while the article does not provide specific details for the synthesis of 35 nm Fe2O3 nanoparticles, it does provide a general method for the synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles using Schiff base templates."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 35 nm Fe2O3 nanoparticles. However, it does describe a general method for the synthesis of Fe2O3 nanoparticles using a Schiff base (SB) template. The SB is a condensation product of aldehyde and amine, and it serves as a prospective template for the synthesis of morphologically different iron oxide. Four different SBs, generated from the permutative combination of two different aldehydes (glyoxal and glutaraldehyde) and two different amines (ethylenediamine and triethylenetetramine), have been employed for this purpose. Mohr’s salt is used as the iron source and hydrazine as the hydrolyzing reagent. The reaction is carried out at a refluxing temperature of 373 K. Under these conditions, morphologically different Fe2O3 nanoparticles are produced in 1 hour as a consequence of dehydration.

The refluxing condition for an hour and the N2 bubble formed from the decomposition of hydrazine affect the crystallisation process by forming a large number of nucleation sites in the reaction medium. This facile synthesis leads to gram-level production of phase pure crystalline γ-Fe2O3 or α-Fe2O3, depending on the variable SB templates' nature. The oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ is a spontaneous process in the ambient condition. The effect of SB templates in the phase-specific formation of Fe2O3 has been elaborated in the article. The advantageous imine group in SBs accelerates the hydrolysis of the metal hydroxide, supporting the benefit of the SB template for the synthesis of Fe2O3 nanoparticles under refluxing conditions.

The PXRD patterns of the synthesized nanoparticles were indexed to γ-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3, confirming the phase purity in the system. The sharp peaks indicate the crystallinity of α- or γ-Fe2O3. The nature of the SB governs the formation of specific phases along with a definite size distribution of particles. However, the article does not provide specific details on how to control the size of the nanoparticles to achieve a specific size such as 35 nm. 

In terms of magnetic properties, as the particle size decreases to the nanoregime, particles with single-magnetic-domain are formed. The term “superparamagnetism” is used to emphasize the magnetic behaviour for paramagnetic nanoparticles which arises from the coupling of several thousands of atoms. This magnetization can reach nearly the saturation magnetization of ferromagnetic iron oxide, but in contrast to ferromagnetic iron, the particles no longer show magnetic interactions after elimination of the magnetic field. The magnetic data of all these synthesized nanoparticles are examined and discussed thoroughly to decipher the linear relationship between the particle size and size-dependent magnetism."

The article does not provide specific instructions for synthesizing Si-CoO nanoparticles of 1000 nm size. However, it does detail the process for creating Si-CoO nanorods with a width of 50-100 nm. 

The synthesis of Si-CoO nanorods was carried out based on a previously published method with minor modifications. The reagents used in the synthesis included cobalt nitrate (0.6926 g), urea (0.6 g), and deionized water (50 mL). These were mixed with different volumes of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 400 uL). The mixture was then transferred into Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves (100 mL) and heated at 100 oC for 3 hours. 

After the heating process, the raw products were centrifuged and washed with pure water and ethanol in turn for 5 times. The raw products were then heated in a nitrogen atmosphere from 20 to 500 oC and maintained at 500 ℃ for 2 hours with a ramp rate of 5 oC min-1. 

The morphology of the Si-CoO was imaged by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The Si-CoO nanorods, with a width of 50-100 nm, were found to be composed of many nanoparticles approximately 15 nm in size. The lattice fringe with approximately 0.21 nm in d-spacing corresponds to the (111) lattice plane of CoO. 

The Si-CoO nanocomposite was found to possess excellent peroxidase-like activity. It quickly catalyzed the colorless substrate 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to be oxidized into blue oxTMB by H2O2 only in 20 seconds. 

In conclusion, while the article does not provide specific instructions for synthesizing 1000 nm Si-CoO nanoparticles, it does provide a detailed method for creating Si-CoO nanorods of 50-100 nm width. The method involves the use of cobalt nitrate, urea, deionized water, and TEOS, and requires the use of Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves, a centrifuge, and a heating process in a nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting Si-CoO nanorods were found to possess excellent peroxidase-like activity."

The article does not provide specific instructions for synthesizing Si-CoO nanoparticles of 1000 nm size. However, it does describe the synthesis of Si-CoO nanorods with a width of 50-100 nm. 

The synthesis of Si-CoO nanorods was based on a publication with a minor modification. The reagents used were cobalt nitrate (0.6926 g), urea (0.6 g), and deionized water (50 mL). Different volumes of TEOS (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 400 uL) were also used. These were mixed thoroughly and transferred into Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves (100 mL) at 100 oC for 3 hours. 

After this, the raw products were centrifuged and washed with pure water and ethanol in turn for 5 times. The raw products were then heated in a nitrogen atmosphere from 20 to 500 oC and maintained at 500 ℃ for 2 hours with a ramp rate of 5 oC min-1. 

The Si-CoO nanorods were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). The results suggest that Si element uniformly distributed onto CoO nanorods with a diameter of 50-100 nm. 

The Si-CoO nanorods were also evaluated for peroxidase-like activity by catalyzing the oxidation of the chromogenic substrate TMB by H2O2. The maximum absorbance of oxTMB was tested at 652 nm. Typically, 0.3 mg mL-1 of Si-CoO was mixed in acetate buffer solution (1.4 mL, pH 5.0), followed by adding of 200 uL of 1 mM TMB solution and 200 uL of 0.25 M H2O2. The absorbance of reaction systems were measured by the UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. 

The kinetic test of Si-CoO was performed by varying concentration of TMB while keeping H2O2 concentration unchanged and vice versa. A series of initial reaction rates were calculated according to the Michaelis-Menten equation. 

In conclusion, while the article does not provide specific instructions for synthesizing 1000 nm Si-CoO nanoparticles, it does provide a detailed procedure for synthesizing Si-CoO nanorods of 50-100 nm size."

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 63 nm SiO2@Co3O4 nanoparticles. However, it does describe a general method for the synthesis of SiO2@Co3O4 core-shell nanorattles. 

The synthesis process involves several steps. Initially, Co2+ ions from the solution are adsorbed on the surface of SiO2 through electrostatic interactions. Urea decomposes to produce NH3 and CO2 and the released NH3 readily reacts with the available Co2+ ions on the surface of SiO2 to form a complex (i.e. Co(NH3)y; y ≤ 2) which reduces the concentration of free Co2+ ions in the solution. After attaining the optimum temperature (e.g. 85 oC), OH– ions are steadily produced through the hydrolysis of urea, which is favorable for nucleation and formation of Co(OH)2 on the surface of SiO2 spheres based on the coalescence mechanism. The Co(OH)2 further undergoes Ostwald ripening to produce flowerlike hierarchical Co(OH)2 on the surface of SiO2.

In the final step, calcination of SiO2@Co(OH)2 in air at 500 oC for 3 h leads to the formation of SiO2@Co3O4 coreshell nanorattles through selftemplate route retaining its 3D hierarchical flowerlike morphology for Co3O4 nanoparticles.

To understand the mechanism of formation of nanorattle structures further, time dependent TEM analysis was performed at different time intervals for SiO2@-Co(OH)2 (S1) (e.g. 2 h, 4 h and 6h) and SiO2@Co3O4 (e.g. 1 h and 3 h). Initially (e.g. 2 h), -Co(OH)2 nanoparticles are formed around the SiO2 spheres. As the reaction proceeds from 2 h to 4 h, inside-out Ostwald ripening process dominates which starts the hollowing process by dissolving the smaller crystallites of -Co(OH)2 present in the interior region. At 6 h, the outer - Co(OH)2 crystallites become larger which creates an interstitial space with the formation of a compact shell. Calcination of SiO2@-Co(OH)2 at 500 oC leads to the formation of SiO2@Co3O4 core-shell nanorattles with the retention of core￾shell nanorattles morphology.

The synthesis of MoS2/Fe3O4 nanocomposites, where Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) mostly grew along the edge of 3D MoS2 “petals”, was achieved via a solvothermal route. The 3D MoS2 nanoflowers were obtained through a hydrothermal method, which was followed by the interaction with FeCl3·6H2O in ethanol solution, leading to the formation of MoS2/Fe3O4 nanocomposites.

The synthesis of MoS2 nanoflowers involved the use of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) and thiourea (CH4N2S). These were added into 30 mL of ultrapure water, and the blue uniform solution was formed under continuous magnetic stirring for 30 minutes. This solution was then subjected to a hydrothermal reaction for 24 hours at 180 °C in a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The products were cooled to room temperature, filtered through a 0.22 μm water-phase filter membrane, subsequently washed by ultrapure water three times and dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 12 hours to obtain black MoS2 nanoflowers.

The preparation of MoS2/Fe3O4 nanocomposites involved the use of the as-prepared MoS2 nanoflowers and iron (III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O). In the presence of 30 mL ethanol absolute, 0.10 g of the MoS2 nanoflowers were mixed with 0.24 g FeCl3·6H2O for 15 minutes for sonication to obtain better dispersity. Then the solution was stepwise added 5 mL ultrapure water and 0.72 g sodium acetate (CH3COONa) followed by 1 hour continuous stirring and solvothermal reaction for 24 hours at 200 °C. The products were cooled to room temperature, magnetically separated, and then washed alternately with ultrapure water and ethanol three times each. The final dark brown magnetic MoS2/Fe3O4 nanocomposites were obtained through vacuum drying at 60 °C for 12 hours.

The micro-morphology of the samples was analyzed using Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi, S-4800) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin). The samples for TEM were firstly dispersed to ethanol absolute, followed by 10 minutes of sonication and addition on the copper grids support. The surface elements, composition and chemical state of the samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ThermoFisher, ESCALAB 250Xi) with an Al Kα source. The absorbance determination and enzyme kinetics analysis were performed on Microplate Readers (Model Super-Max 3500FL). Mott-Scottky curves were recorded on CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai) with the usual three-electrode system (Na2SO4 electrolyte (0.1 M), 1 k Hz).

The synthesis of MoS2@MgFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) involves several steps and requires a variety of materials and equipment. 

Firstly, the materials required for the synthesis include Ferric(III) trichloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O), magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2·6H2O), dodecylamine (DDA), ammonium tetrathiomolybdate ((NH4)2MoS4, ATTM), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O), and ethylene glycol (EG). All these materials were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company and used as received.

In this process, 5.6 mmol FeCl3·6H2O, 2.8 mmol MgCl2·6H2O and 7 mmol DDA are dispersed in 70 mL EG and continuously stirred at room temperature. The obtained transparent solution is then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated at 200 oC for 18 hours. After cooling to ambient temperature naturally, the black precipitate is collected by centrifuge, washed several times with ethanol and DI water, and then dried at 60 oC overnight.

To prepare MoS2@MgFe2O4, 132 mg ATTM is dissolved in 60 mL DMF, and 1 mL N2H4·H2O is slowly added to the solution and sonicated for 1 hour. Then, 50 mg of the prepared MgFe2O4 is homogeneously dispersed in the mixture. The mixture is then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave and held at 200 oC for 10 hours. After cooling to ambient temperature naturally, the precipitate is centrifuged, washed several times with ethanol and DI water, and then dried at 70 oC overnight. Pure MoS2 nanoparticles are prepared using the same steps without adding MgFe2O4.

The synthesized MoS2@MgFe2O4 NPs are then characterized using various instruments. SEM was recorded on an S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microanalyzer (Hitachi, Japan). TEM was carried out on a Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope (Philips, Netherlands). XRD patterns were obtained by a Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker-AXS, Germany) with 2θ ranging from 5 to 70°. XPS measurements were examined with an ESCALAB 250 Xi photoelectron spectrometer using Al Kα radiation (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, US).

The synthesis of MoS2-Pt0.74Ag0.26 nanoparticles (NPs) involves several steps and requires various reagents and equipment. The process begins with the preparation of MoS2 nanosheets through a liquid exfoliation method. Commercial MoS2 powder is first ground and then intercalated with concentrated H2SO4, which breaks the van der Waals interaction forces in bulk MoS2. The H2SO4-intercalated intermediate is collected by centrifugation and repeatedly washed with ultrapure water to remove residual H2SO4. After that, the obtained intermediate is functionalized with a highly hydrophilic surfactant polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) through physical adsorption in water under bath sonication condition, followed by probe sonication treatment to give MoS2-PAH nanosheets.

The next step is the preparation of MoS2-Pt0.74Ag0.26 hybrids. After 3 mL of MoS2-PAH solution (about 0.1 mg mL-1) was dispersed in 1 mL of ultrapure water, the solution was sonicated for 10 min, followed by adding 0.3 μmol of AgNO3, 0.9 μmol of H2PtCl6 and 10 μL of aqueous solution of HCHO solution (40 %). Then the resulting mixture was transferred to a 10-mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and was heated at 180°C for 4 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the obtained hybrid material was separated by centrifugation at 12000 r.p.m. for 10 min, washed with ultrapure water, and then dispersed into ultrapure water.

The characterization of the prepared MoS2-Pt0.74Ag0.26 NPs was performed using various techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a FEI Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected on a Hitachi S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Bruker D8 focus with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were collected with a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 U-TWIN.

To prepare the MoS2-Pt74Ag26 hybrids, H2PtCl6·6H2O and AgNO3 as metal precursors are reduced by HCHO under hydrothermal conditions and PtAg alloys are formed on the MoS2-PAH nanosheets. The as-prepared MoS2-PtAg nanohybrids are then characterized in detail. The average size of PtAg NPs is about 13 nm with narrow size distribution. The analysed atomic ratio (Pt/Ag) by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) is 74 : 26, which is very close to the Pt/Ag feeding ratio of 3 : 1.

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 15 nm Fe-Ag2S nanoparticles, including the exact quantities of reagents in mmols. However, it does describe the general process of synthesizing Fe-Ag2S nanocomposites, as well as the equipment and reagents used.

The synthesis process of Fe-Ag2S nanocomposites was as follows: Firstly, Ag2S was prepared successfully following a typical procedure: NaOH solution (2 M, 0.95 mL) was mixed with thiourea solution (Tu, 0.26 M, 10 mL) under stirring, and then, the mixed solution was added into the AgNO3 solution (0.39 M, 5 mL) slowly to form Ag2S.

The reagents used in the experiment were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent (Shanghai, China) and Solarbio (Beijing, China). Notably, all of these reagents were analytical grade and used directly without any further purification. Ultrapure water used throughout the experiment was prepared by the Flom water purification system.

The apparatus used in the experiment included Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) for obtaining images of the prepared nanomaterials. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed by Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was measured by a PHI Quantera SXM spectrometer to ensure the iron states in Fe-Ag2S. The presence of elements was confirmed by energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). UV-vis absorption spectra and fluorometric measurement were carried out on the TU-1810PC UV-vis absorption spectrometer and HITACHI F-4600 spectrophotometers, respectively.

The morphology of the prepared Ag2S and Fe doped Ag2S nanocomposites were shown using TEM. The EDS mapping profiles of the sample was obtained to confirm Fe doped Ag2S nanocomposites was prepared successfully. The XRD patterns of Ag2S before and after doped with iron were also analyzed.

However, the article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 15 nm Fe-Ag2S nanoparticles, including the exact quantities of reagents in mmols."

The morphology of the prepared Ag2S and Fe doped Ag2S nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 1 (A) and (B), respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 1 (A), the pure Ag2S seems to apparent aggregation, which was negative for the catalytic activity of Ag2S used in catalytic reaction due to the decreasing active sites resulted from the severe aggregation. Compared to the pure Ag2S, Fe-Ag2S NCs displayed good dispersion after Fe doped into Ag2S, shown in Fig. 1 (B), suggesting that the doping of iron raised the dispersity of Ag2S and further increased the number of active sites, and hence, the catalytic performance would be improved, as discussed later.

In addition, in order to confirm Fe doped Ag2S nanocomposites was prepared successfully, EDS mapping profiles of the sample was obtained. As shown in Fig. 1 (C), it can be found that all of the elements existed in the nanocomposites, just as we expected. As we can see from the inset of Fig. 1 (B), the lattice fringe with a d-spacing of 0.408 nm was ascribed to (121) crystal planes of Ag2S, which is consistent with the following XRD data.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of Ag2S before (red line) and after (black line) doped with iron, respectively. From Fig. 2, it can be found that Ag2S are all attributed to the monoclinic Ag2S [JCPDS 14-0072], and the Fe-Ag2S pattern is nearly the same as Ag2S, indicating that the doping of iron could not change the crystallographic form [32]. However, the difference is that, the XRD diffraction peaks of Fe-Ag2S were broadened compared to Ag2S, indicating a smaller grain size after doping, consistent with the explanation for TEM, that is, Fe doping improved the dispersity of Ag2S and prevented it from aggregating. 

To further confirm the iron presence and state doped in the Ag2S, XPS was employed as a powerful tool to solve the problem. Fig. 3 (A) displayed the survey scan spectra of the as-synthesized Fe-Ag2S nanocomposites, from which we can see the elements including Fe, Ag and S existed in the Fe-Ag2S nanocomposites, according with the EDS mapping profiles. 

All of these results proved that the Fe-doped Ag2S NCs were prepared successfully. However, the specific size of the nanoparticles, such as 15 nm, is not mentioned in the article."

The synthesis of nitrogen-doped titania nanoparticles (NPs) was carried out using a freeze-drying method. The process began with the preparation of a titanium precursor solution. To do this, 5 mmol of titanium isopropoxide was dissolved in 30 mL of isopropanol. This solution was then stirred for 1 hour at a moderate magnetic stirring rate. 

Next, varying amounts of urea (2, 4, and 6 g) were added as a nitrogen doping precursor to the solution and stirred for another hour. After stirring, the solution was transferred to a Petri dish and frozen at -30°C before being subjected to freeze-drying treatment. In the freeze-drying process, the samples were placed in a freeze dryer for 24 hours at -35°C. 

After freeze-drying, the sol was converted into a fluffy powder which was further ground into a fine powder. Finally, to remove any bound moisture, solvents, and impurities, these samples were calcined at 400°C for 3 hours at a ramp of 5°C/min.

The imidazole-based ionic liquid (IL) namely 1-H-3-methylimidazolium acetate (HMIM OAc) was synthesized using the neutralization route of synthesis. Equimolar volume of acetic acid was added drop-wise into 1-methylimidazole medium under cooling conditions and subsequently, the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours to obtain the desired IL. After stirring, the IL was subjected to a rotary evaporator for six hours under low pressure to remove the moisture and unreacted reactants.

The preparation of ionic liquid-based nitrogen-doped titania was carried out as follows: Three different concentrations of N-doped TiO2 (4.5 mg) were added into the protic IL 1-H-3-methylimidazolium acetate (HMIM OAc) (1 mL) and mechanically ground for 30 minutes in a pestle-mortar until a well-dispersed ionic liquid-based N-doped TiO2 was achieved.

The peroxidase-like activity of the IL coated N-doped TiO2 was analyzed through colorimetric detection of H2O2, in the presence of TMB dye as a catalytic substrate. The absorption spectrum was monitored by a double beam UV–Vis. spectra at a wavelength of 652 nm, under varying concentrations of H2O2.

The synthesis of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is described in the provided text. However, the specific size of 200 nm is not mentioned. The synthesis process involves several steps and uses various materials and equipment.

The synthesis of rGO is carried out following a typical procedure, but without the use of Na2PdCl4. The materials used for the synthesis are not specified in the text. The characterization of the materials involves the use of a Shimadzu RF-6000 spectrofluorometer for fluorescence spectra, a UV-8000 spectrophotometer for UV-vis absorption spectra, and a JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope (TEM) for size and morphology characterization. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) are recorded on a JEM-2010 (HR) microscope. The thickness of the Pd nanoplates is characterized by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) operating in contact mode with standard silicon nitride tips at room temperature under ambient conditions.

The synthesis of {100} PdSP@rGO involves the use of KBr, AA, PVP, and GO in a glass pressure vessel. The mixture is preheated at 80 °C under stirring for 10 min, and then Na2PdCl4 in water is quickly added. The vessel is capped and kept at 80 °C for 3 h. After the reaction, the mixture is cooled to room temperature in an ice bath. The product is washed with water and ethanol several times.

The synthesis of Pd nanoplates on rGO enclosed by {111} facets [{111} PdNP@rGO] is similar to the synthesis of {100} PdSP@rGO, except for replacing KBr with KCl. Pd nanocubes are prepared according to previous literatures. PVP, AA, and KBr are dissolved in water and pre-heated in air under stirring at 80 °C for 10 min. Then, an aqueous Na2PdCl4 solution is added. After the vial has been capped, the reaction is allowed to proceed at 80 °C for 3 h.

The morphologies of the Pd nanomaterials are initially determined by TEM. The {100}PdSP@rGO presents a uniform square-like morphology with an average edge length of ca. 200 nm and 3 nm in thickness. The HRTEM image indicates that nanoplates are single crystal with well-defined fringes. A lattice spacing of 0.20 nm can be attributed to the {100} facets of Pd with fcc structure. The TEM image of Pd nanoplates enclosed with {111} facets shows clear lattice fringes with interplanar spacing of 0.22 and 0.24 nm, corresponding to the {111} basal planes and 1/3 {422} planes of the {111}PdNP@rGO, respectively. Pd nanocubes and rGO nanosheets are also successfully obtained."

A lattice spacing of 0.20 nm can be attributed to the {100} facets of Pd with fcc structure, similar to the observation in previous studies. 

In the absence of GO, Pd nanocubes instead of Pd nanoplates can be obtained. And rGO could be synthesized in the absence of Pd salt precursor. The thickness of the Pd nanoplates was characterized by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Nanoscopt 8 Multimode Scanning Probe microscope (Vecco)) operating in contact mode with standard silicon nitride tips at room temperature under ambient conditions."

The synthesis of Pd-Ir NPs, including those of 3 nm size, was achieved through a two-step, seed-mediated growth method previously published by the group. In the first step, Pd NPs of different sizes as seeds were synthesized in one-pot synthesis. In the second step, the Pd NPs were coated with Ir shells of roughly the same thicknesses (2-3 atomic layers in this study). 

Taking the synthesis of 5.9 nm Pd-Ir NPs as an example, monodispersed Pd NPs were first synthesized. The Pd NPs had a slightly truncated octahedral shape and displayed a great uniformity. The sizes of the Pd NPs was measured to be 4.8 ± 0.6 nm. Then, the Pd NPs were coated with Ir, where an ethylene glycol solution of Na3IrCl6 as Ir precursor was slowly introduced into a mixture containing the 4.8 nm Pd NPs as seeds, L-ascorbic acid as reductant and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP55000) as stabilizer. 

The resultant Pd-Ir NPs as products maintained the truncated octahedral shape, implying a conformal coating of Ir on Pd NPs. The sizes of the Pd-Ir NPs was measured to be 5.9 ± 0.7 nm. The increase of overall particles size of 1.1 nm indicated the Ir shell thickness was about 0.55 nm, corresponding to approximately 2-3 Ir atomic layers. 

Size control of the Pd-Ir NPs can be conveniently achieved by using Pd seeds of different sizes. During the synthesis, the thickness of Ir shells can be tuned by varying the amounts of Pd seeds and Ir precursor. Pd-Ir NPs of 3.3 ± 0.5 nm, 9.8 ± 0.9 nm and 13.0 ± 1.0 nm, respectively, were synthesized when Pd NPs of 2.3 ± 0.3 nm, 8.7 ± 1.0 nm and 12.1 ± 1.2 nm were used as seeds. It should be noted that the thickness of Ir shell for all these Pd-Ir NPs was controlled to be roughly the same (ca. 0.5 nm), which can be estimated by measuring the increase of particle size after Ir growth.

The molar ratio of Ir to Pd for this sample was determined to be about 1:3.5 by using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping image of an individual NP confirmed the elemental distributions of Pd core and Ir shell, which is consistent with the characterization data of previous studies. 

The article does not provide specific details on the mmols of the reagents used or the specific equipment used for the synthesis. However, it is clear that the synthesis process involves the use of ethylene glycol solution of Na3IrCl6 as Ir precursor, L-ascorbic acid as reductant, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP55000) as stabilizer, and Pd NPs as seeds. The sizes of the Pd-Ir NPs are controlled by the sizes of the Pd seeds used and the amount of Ir precursor. The characterization of the synthesized NPs involves the use of high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping."

High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image of representative Pd-Ir NPs clearly showed the continuous lattice fringes along the <111> directions and the smooth surfaces, suggesting Ir was epitaxially grown on Pd seeds and the Pd-Ir NPs were primarily covered by Ir(111) facets.

The text does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 100 nm MnO2 nanoparticles (NPs). It mentions the use of PtNPs (platinum nanoparticles) which are capped with citrate ions to facilitate the binding of MnO2 nanosheets. The citrate ions also act as a reducing agent to aid the formation of the MnO2 nanosheets. However, the exact process, reagents, and quantities used for the synthesis of the MnO2 NPs are not specified in the text. 

The text does provide some information about the structure and composition of the PtNPs@MnO2 nanocomposite. The PtNPs are composed of aggregates of small nanoclusters (2-3 nm) and the MnO2 nanosheets form a 3-dimensional scaffold adhered to the PtNPs, encapsulating them. The diameter of the PtNPs@MnO2 is approximately 250 nm with the PtNPs having a diameter of ca. 45 nm and the MnO2 nanosheet being ca.100 nm. 

The structure of PtNPs@MnO2 in solution was analysed by cryo-EM (cryo-electron microscopy) and the images were recorded at the tilt angle from -60° to +60°. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the PtNPs@MnO2 confirms that the Pt core is composed of small Pt nanoclusters resulting in a rough bulk surface. A distinctive lattice fringe of the MnO2 nanosheets is observed in the rim section of the PtNPs within the nanocomposite, indicating the core and shell are in direct contact. 

The composition of the PtNPs@MnO2 was confirmed by EDS (Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) mapping analysis, with O and Mn in the nanosheets region and Pt located at the centre. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also used to further analyse the composition and valence states of the PtNPs@MnO2.

The citrate ions can also act as a reducing agent further aiding the formation of the MnO2 nanosheets. However, the text does not provide specific information on the quantities of these reagents used, the process of combining them, or the conditions under which the synthesis takes place.

The text does provide some information on the characterization of the nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the PtNPs show that they are composed of aggregates of small nanoclusters (2-3 nm). The MnO2 nanosheets form a 3-dimensional scaffold adhered to the PtNPs, so as to encapsulate them. The diameter of the PtNPs@MnO2 is approximately 250 nm with the PtNPs having a diameter of ca. 45 nm and the MnO2 nanosheet being ca.100 nm. The structure of PtNPs@MnO2 in solution was analysed by cryo-EM. The images were recorded at the tilt angle from -60° to +60° and reconstruction of the tomograms of the nanocomposite was applied to generate the structure.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to further analyse the composition and valence states of the PtNPs@MnO2. The XPS full spectrum of the PtNPs@MnO2 reveals the presence of O, Mn and Pt. Strong peaks at 653.9 and 642.1 eV are observed in the high resolution XPS of Mn, with a spin-energy separation of 11.8 eV, which can be assigned to Mn(IV) from MnO2, and is consistent with the XPS of MnO2 nanosheets prepared similarly.

In terms of the catalytic activity of the PtNPs@MnO2, an aqueous TMB solution and the PtNPs@MnO2 stock solution were added to NaAc buffer at room temperature. UV-vis spectra were recorded over a period of 30 min. The influence of temperature (20-70°C) and pH (3.0-6.0) were investigated. In a steady-state kinetic assay, the catalytic reaction of the PtNPs@MnO2 was determined by varying the concentration of TMB under the standard conditions. The concentration of oxidized TMB (oxTMB) was calculated by applying the Beer-Lambert law using a molar absorption coefficient of 3.9×104 M-1 cm-1. The apparent steady-state reaction velocity was obtained by calculating the slopes of initial absorbance change with time. By plotting the reaction velocity against the concentration of the TMB, typical Michaelis-Menten curves were obtained. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was fitted from the Michaelis-Menten curves. The steady-state kinetic parameters were calculated using the Lineweaver-Burk plot of the double reciprocal of the Michaelis-Menten equation.

The article does not provide specific details on the synthesis of 10 nm Pd nanoparticles. It only mentions that the synthesis of palladium (Pd) nanocrystals, enclosed by either {111} or {100} facets, was carried out using a hydrothermal method, as described previously. The concentrations of Pd nanocrystals were measured with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Element 2, Thermo Finnigan, Germany) after the nanocrystals were dissolved with a mixture of HCl and HNO3 (3:1, volume ratio). The morphologies of nanocrystals were examined using a FEI TECNAI G2 transmission electron microscopy (TEM), operating at 200 kV. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Tecnai F20, FEI, USA) images were taken on a field-emission high-resolution transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. However, the article does not provide specific information on the reagents, their quantities, or the exact parameters of the experiment used for the synthesis of these nanoparticles."
